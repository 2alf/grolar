grizzly and polar bears i have a fear of more than any other animal and now you’re telling me there’s a hybrid of the two combined?! 😭

and we deserve it.

that’s what humans get for melting that bears home😅

lucky i live in texas

pissly bears oh wait-

first up how did the "interaction" even took place

these have been around for a while, but they’re relatively new, but what he’s saying is scary and sadly true

we hace a polar brown bear mix at my zoo, dunno why they let it happen

my great grandpa was in his house and he say a polar bear coming and the bear banged on the walls and my gramps put his ear to the wall and heard....

un tysmé sucré ça 🥲

moving south has never seemed like a better choice

...is it a skinned bear at the beginning...

i've read 3 sentences of this article and i'm like "what in the crap"

yup, we’re all gonna die

now we have to worry about the bears evolving??

it’s a pissed off polar bear on steroids!!!!

i’m from northern canada. i promise they won’t make it far south. they’ll stick to the snow.

it’s not like polar bears only live in the snow. they live in grasslands and tundras as well.

i’m good, no thank you

what about the fires down there? i heard the bears make it way south

exactly!!! they probably think it’s hell on earth down there and head right back up

right! we have it bad enough without hybrid bears🙄

i love it!

i. want. one

imagine having to explain to your insurance company that your car was destroyed by a grizzly bear and a polar bear hybrid 😂

where is this global warming everyone is talking about?

just when you thought the 2020s couldn’t get any weirder

waiting for someone to say "we're the virus"

this sounds like a fantasy creature wth is it doing in reality

bruhhh what

this sounds like a made-up headline. you sure this is real?

wellllll, now it’s just getting ridiculous

hmmm a new animal to be terrified of. fantastic!

okay i'm not even joking but i'm low key about to cry. i'm not ready for bears.

the world is officially ending. see y’all in another life ✌🏽

bears really about to conquer the world. first clowns, now bears.

i hope they're cute.

imagine if you see that bear

oh hell no

sooooo should i not go hiking anymore?

how do you even get a hybrid bear? like were they put in the same enclosure or what???

bro my mom made the same joke she said it’s gonna be called a pissly bear😭

noo that's a dream of mine

they just want hugs and snacks

can they have babies together? i want to see the baby

haha bears go brrrr

i was really gonna go camping in alaska this summer but- 😳

and i wanted to go to alaska

not sure what to put here.

i'm safe; i live in michigan. nothing ever happens in michigan.

honestly, let 'em take us out 🤷🏽‍♀️

wait if it’s a crossbreed between bears, would they be infertile because they aren’t the same, like a liger please answer

they really said piss bear... also, what's the difference between pizzly and grolar?

americans and canadians are scared of australian animals, but our bears are tiny, slow, and vegetarian.

are pizzly bears fertile though? usually, when two different species have a hybrid, usually they cannot reproduce (mule, liger, etc.)

it's always the lightskins who are dangerous.

this nonsense gonna be in your backyard sooner 😭

this is white genocide; stormfront was right all along.

brown guys only want white girls 😞

can a pizzly and a pizzly make a baby, or are they sterile like mules?

the info: 😥‼️😣😰👿🏴‍☠️🔪🪓❌🚩. the music: 😁💖💖🤧🤧🥳🥳😍😍😂🤪😜🦄🌝🌈🌈

whole-ass pokémon names.

me in africa worrying about animals that probably won't kill me 👈

climate change is just the earth's back-up plan in case humans mess up.

you can call them "grolars" or "puzzles"; i call them "karma."

we did this to ourselves; we deserve to get clapped by these hybrids.

you guys know the ice caps have been melting since the last ice age, right? we just sped things up.

pizzley bears...

soooo can these things have babies, or are they sterile like mules?

pissly bears...

pandas already biracial, but this is horrendous.

so can these hybrid offspring themselves

We don't take care of nature; nature adapts. At this rate, the animals could evolve to hunt us. The age of man is here, and it's all downhill to extinction.
No jungle fever jokes? Sheeesh. The times have changed lol

Im more worried about a lightskin bear takin my girl than my head.
Naw, they RIZZLY bears now.
They Polar bears in Grizzly bear territory. Oh well, new apex pred 😭
look, it's not nature doing this; it's the GOVERNMENT.
Which one comes first, pizzly or grolar bear? Which one went on an interracial thingy?
It's called diversity.
Beautiful fur color. Let’s hope they won’t be hunted to extinction for it.
The two most aggressive bear types interbreed; are you kidding me 😭 humanity is screwed.
Yeah, this is convincing me that mother nature has been trying to kill us for a while now.
"LIGHTSKIN BEARS," AHHAHAHAHAHA.
I live in the desert.
We kinda did this one to ourselves.
What “SOME” White Americans are afraid of😅
It's so sad that polar bears are going extinct because we can't take responsibility for our part in global warming. 🥺
So... we forced a natural hybrid that can wipe us out... good to know

polar bears are one of the few animals that see us as food, because food is so scarce in their habitat they'd take anything
weren't polar bears evolved from grizzlies from migration to the north? now they're just coming back and making another species of bears
good, I hope they eat us all. humans are overrated and need to go.
polar bears are just grizzlies adapted to the cold so it’s not really too bad but it’s definitely not good 😂

It’s evolution
I feel like humanity has it coming.
I love bear
can the offspring mate with each other? some hybrids can't
Hybrids like vamp diar
The Jurassic park reference was nice
Wait does that mean pandas and grizzlys can do the uhhh yea
They can’t breed tho right
Next is honey badger and Wolverine
TWo races coming together
damn that sounds familiar.....
megafauna is on its way out. every large species of animal that isn't domesticated is going extinct in the new 300 years.
If polar bears mated with black bears would we have grey bears?
bring it to Florida 😌
You’ll have to pet it from the inside.... 😳🤣
ok. but can they reproduce. or are they like mules
yeah I just learned that in science class
Are these light skin bears bigger then the polar and grizzly bears?
It’s the fact that it’s ALL TRUE! 🤦🏾‍♀️
They’ve been a thing since 2014 I think, but now is happening naturally
That’s why I carry a gun
Bruh light skin bears 😂

yes! let's combine two of the strongest and unpredictable bears in north america. being a hiker wasn't scary enough!  keep in mind polar bears see people as food and there's little we can do about them. not saying to kill off the polar bear but humans can't normal live in those terrains. nature is fighting back.

does the polar bear and grizzly bear have the same type of courtship when breeding or did the polar bear just do whatever it wanted when it saw a grizzly?

life fids a way. since grizzly eats 90% vegi and the polar eats near 100% meat will the new species be more of an aggressive hunter than the grizzly? that could mean bad news for people exploring.

polar bears have over double in population since the first study in the 60s.  they have only been left on the "vulnerable" status because many organizations refuse to actually submit real numbers and instead use an estimate that is purely speculative and by most every real number study is false, has been false and continues to be false.  polar bears are moving south because there are to many to live off the seals in the arctic. is ice reduction an issue.  yes, in the s they actually happen but there have been record setting ice in the same decdes as record setting lack of ice.   what we really know is we have no idea what long term weather may or may not do to the polar bear populations.  hey i know people are an issue but lying is as bad as ignoring the issue.

it’s not like polar bears only live in the snow. they live in grasslands and tundras as well.

i’m good, no thank you

right! we have it bad enough without hybrid bears🙄

are pizzly bears fertile though? usually, when two different species have a hybrid, usually they cannot reproduce (mule, liger, etc.)

it's always the lightskins who are dangerous.

this nonsense gonna be in your backyard sooner 😭

this is white genocide; stormfront was right all along.

brown guys only want white girls 😞

can a pizzly and a pizzly make a baby, or are they sterile like mules?

me in africa worrying about animals that probably won't kill me 👈

climate change is just the earth's back-up plan in case humans mess up.

you can call them "grolars" or "puzzles"; i call them "karma."

we did this to ourselves; we deserve to get clapped by these hybrids.

you guys know the ice caps have been melting since the last ice age, right? we just sped things up.

pizzley bears...

soooo can these things have babies, or are they sterile like mules?

pissly bears...

pandas already biracial, but this is horrendous.

so can these hybrid offspring themselves

you just can't get any information with out the climate cult mantras, can you 😓

what we really know is we have no idea what long term weather may or may not do to the polar bear populations.
we had coyote/wolf mixes where i used to live. smartest canines i've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. they weren't afraid of humans, just cautious around us. they traveled in groups of 3 (6 total) and hunted the local foxes and cats out before going after the deer. there was one in particular that would try to "sneakily" follow me along the river bank. i say that with quotations because the  dingus was too big to hide in the bank grass lol

i'm surprised you didn't mention the coywolf. also raccoons have been splitting into two species over the last few hundred s. the city raccoons are now faster in a drag race than their country cousins. four-lane road crossings eliminated the slower ones from gene pool.

thank you - great episode - perfect examples of how during different times of existence it's important to be able to be flexible - becoming a generalist and able to take advantage of anything that exists, in order to survive, while at times becoming a specialist for the purpose of differentiation and survival. this is both at a macro level (over long periods of time as animals adapt within their species to survive) as well as micro-level (with the individual human having to redefine our own skills to become more specialized as we search to find a career that will span more than just a couple of s). change is constant - thank you real science

my cousin has a hybrid snake. he took a male corn snake and mated it with a female black ratsnake. the resulting mixes were kind of strange looking and he kept 1 of them and sold the rest but he specifically sold them as hybrids. i don't know if they would be considered true hybrids though because a corn snake is technically a kind of ratsnake as well. different ratsnakes and corn snakes have been known to mate in the wild occasionally as well.

it’s not hard to imagine a grizzly/polar hybrid as they are the same animal species but just live in slightly different climates. so i’d be curious to know how that happened 🙂

29





pizzly and grolar bears have two different body plans. the pizzly has the body plan of a polar bear, so it should have a close to the same lifestyle as the polar bear. while the grolar bear has the body plan of a grizzly, so it should have a lifestyle similar to that of a grizzly. both may be better suited to the artic/sub-artic all the way down to more temperate climates. with the pizzly staying more north while the grolar moving further south. at least if the body plan is taken into account and that translates over to them, taking after one parent more than the other in their diets.

i’ve been learning a lot of this in my evolution and ecology class, very interesting to see other examples of hybridization!

2:02 mins in, i can say that i think the reason why animals are hybridizing is to share more positive traits across environments since humans are taking more of their natural habitats. like the best of both worlds.

there are also other hybrids showing up in other places. in northern ontario we commonly see crosses with wolves and coyotes. we call them coywolf. they have the opportunistic and inquiry of a coyotes and the bite force and strength of a wolf.

i'm curious is anyone ever thought that ,just maybe, all of these ice breakers plowing through the see ice for miles at a time is allowing the ice to move more than it naturally would and that could potentially be causing way more issues that possibly calculable.





i would really appreciate it if you would tell me the difference between a grizzly and an alaskan brown bear.  i've heard that the difference is dietary in that the brown bears gorge on salmon and the grizzly is a true omnivore, eating everything from bugs to elk, deer, and moose.  thanks.  i really look forward to your answer and i appreciated the video.  there are the coywolves that are fascinating and were the subject of a nat'l geographic video.

about the polar bear/grizzly hybridization killing the polar bear as a species i think there is a flaw - as far as i know this only happens in north america and the polar bear has a wide distribution around the arctic - so the species would still exist there (since i assume the hybrid would not be traveling far outside it's habitat to go on sea ice, like the polar bear would)





first off i want to say that i have thoroughly enjoyed your videos including this one. however, i have heard that polar bear populations have been steadily increasing. i quickly googled "polar bear population graph" and the couple links i clicked on supported what i have heard. i am not a climate change denier but have heard that connection between warming oceans hasn't negatively affected polar bears the same across their ranges. i did find that in less than half of their sub-ranges the numbers are declining while over half have stable or increasing populations. if you could do some research on this and get back to me i would appreciate it. again great work!

53





well, its be going on for a long time. in the 80's i morphed into the hybrid known as monkey-pony, long before grizzles started boning polar bears. monkey-pony had thousands of chromosomes and he was a joy and a terror. he was officially assassinated in gatlinburg, tennessee in 1986 on halloween night, his acura legend flipping down a snowy mountain. i woke up 3 months later and monkey-pony was no more. today was the first time i have even begun to understand that hybrid mutation again, thanks to this video. neeeeheeeeoooooowwwwaaahhhhaaa! he may be reborn, pray it happens! peace

fun fact polar bear population has increased 30% since 2005

very interesting. there was a hybrid bear in the zoo in the next larger town from where i live. that's how i found out that these exist.





wow. what a leap for the narluga, especially due to the fact that narwhals are mythical creatures. (at least i always thought that they were) i have both a leopard gecko and a spotted salamander, who live in separate tanks. if i were to put them in the same tank together- (#!) they might interbreed and create a hybrid, or- (#2)- the gecko would devour the salamander whole.

this is depressing i hate to see a favorite animal go extinct and i know my support won't help at all, i'm glad i got to see one at my zoo when i was little.

what do y'all think the pizzly bears' ecological niche should be in order to avoid competition with their purebred counterparts the grizzly bear and the polar bear?





there was a polar-grizzly hybrid reported back in the late 70's early 80's by a guide up in the brooks range. 
it was just a sighting.the guy didn't shoot it because he wasn't sure what the season was for it.





this video let me on a wild research to find out what about hybridization on wolves, coyotes, and dogs. i for one, am 30% confident that my dog has some coyote ancestry. and even the vet told me that he suspected that my dog was probably the offspring of a coyote (my dog is the offspring of a house dog, and a street dog(?) in an area where coyotes are plentiful). it is not uncommon to see coyotes running around with other street dogs.





a very informative video infused with a healthy dose of environmental fatalism, practically delivering last rights to the polar bears. kinda unexpected since that runs counter to the speaker's feelings about the news. i could have done with less doom about the bears future's, as i believe it to be a bit early to be sealing their extinction.

10




this seems like such a beautiful progression of life, over time! with the boundaries of different species fading away, what new and unique creations of nature could we see prowling the wildlands? 😲

2





1 
coywolves (coyote x wolves) tend to pop up as well, especially along the geographical edges where the two populations intermingle. in fact, a decent portion of red and eastern wolves have coyote genetics. this makes coywolves larger than coyotes, smaller than wolves, and they form more cohesive social units. i live in the great lakes region, so it strikes me as interesting just how many hybrids exist.

31




this makes sense. both bears came from the same family. the gene poole is stunningly close. polar bears evolved from brown bears. then became a marine mammal by statistic. now the beats are meeting and breeding. land regions are now overlapping. making this possible.





as a sort of a, hybrid myself,i find this subject most fascinating,that animals will do what they, must to ensure their genes  move on,to the next generation.






1




can you guys make a more detailed video about how modern humans are a mix of different types of “old” humans ?

i remember a doctor calling me hybrid. it hurt but it was good to know and opened my eyes. not only did our ancestors mate and create hybrids we're doing it today. black/white asian/black etc people get upset but it's just the truth. doesn't make us any less but also shows we're not too far off from the animals that roam the earth that we swear we're better than. i wish i didn't know the truth sometimes but 🤷 it's not like it ruined my life

actually it is possible for a mule to have offspring albeit rare. the latest i've heard of was in colorado, and yes it was proven genetically. thought to occur when by astronomical chance a viable gamete is formed during meiosis.

what an amazing informative video. i was hooked from the beginning.

3




possibly the best short video on hybridation.
thank you 🙏🏻





also it's very possible pizzlys/grolars take the trait of being extremely aggressive towards humans meaning we are just writing our own death





the last hybrid polar bear/grizzly killed in the arctic was a hybrid of a hybrid. they are getting established, but local people hunt them, so hybrids may struggle to survive.

4





what this video doesn't tell you: polar bear numbers are skyrocketing, and by 2030, they're expected to pass grizzlies in population for the first time ever (despite the fact that grizzles are also doing well). the actual reason for increased hybridization is the expansion of their range and the explosion of their population.

1




just a thought watching the video (great video as always), when talking about the time since two species diverged, wouldn't it be interesting to add an estimated amount of generations? because i suppose 150k s of evolution to a drosophila isn't the same as to a polar bear.

133





very interesting video and exactly my experience with the news. will try morning brew. had heard of it, but didn't think it was free!





i seen a squirrel once that was all black with a reddish brown tail once, pretty much everything from the same species and breed with each other, it’s always pretty intreating when you come across such things tho!

this is something i've always thought about when it comes to conservation. like, is trying to keep certain species alive slowing down evolution? 🤔





i hope scientist are capturing a variety of endangered species dna samples. since stopping extinction of many species seems impossible, given the size of the problem and human attitude, perhaps we'll be able to revive these species in the future. hopefully, responsibly.

they called it a polar grizz, and why did you not specify that the bear was located in sachs harbour, northwest territories. the communities that these discoveries are made in deserve recognition.






1 
i have a question , will or can those hybrids mate with others and produce an offspring ?

2




a brown bear and a polar bear are a species in the same genus. many species in the same genus are very capable of mating and producing fertile offspring. african cichlids have an "order" in which they will cross. if you have a tank with breeding group from the same genus, your chances of crossing rise, so does the aggression. if every group if from a different genus that chance goes down drastically. they are all from the same family though, so one genus may have species that are closely related to each other. the hybrid brown/polar bear has siblings and at least one is unrecognizable as a hybrid by sight. just as hybrid fish. the mother will have fry from the same clutch, some will look exactly like mom, some dad and some a mix. hybrids exist everywhere, just because humans can't differentiate by sight, doesn't mean they don't exist.





what's fascinating to think about, is how these different animals species naturally "know" whether or not they can produce viable offspring, obviously without the aide of any human. truly mind-boggling stuff

1





should be obvious. after all, wolves and dogs remain capable of interbreeding even though we tend to treat them as different "species". despite the fact that many dogs have been artificially bred into radically different forms from their common ancestors with modern wolves.

701





is it actually hybridization, or is this one path that evolution takes and we just happened to begin to discover it by bringing out ligers? i mean, the grizzly and polar bears clearly would be the ancestors of this new bear, though the polar bear is actually a great example of an animal returning to sea.





the polar bear is actually a evolution of the grizzly bear. there were grizzly bears/brown bear that got stuck on the ice and adapted to the habitat so that makes sense that they can mate..





in college i did a case study of a hybrid program done in the early 1800's...it involved an arab human man, breeding with a female silver back gorilla... fortunately the trails were successful and the new hybrids were released into the wild vastness of australia and left to roam...200yrs. later and the hybrids from that breeding program are said to have been born fertile, have survived, reproduced, but are said to resemble the first of there kind 100%...  those successful hybrids  are today better known as australias aboriginals...





i could think of nothing more terrifying to encounter in the wild that a hungry grolar.





some species can produce fertile hybrids if they ate closely related enough. appears to be so with polar bears and grizzlies.





for those wondering: hybrids are named based on their parents. the father species (lion) & the mother species (tiger) is what results in the name like liger or narluga or pizzly bear. they're not just given silly names for no reason.

someone used this video for their best, horse, donkey, and mule stock footage and i really love it lol. they saw it, and jumped on it. mules aren't useless tho, you seriously get the best of two species.

there was recently a hybrid of an american paddlefish and a russian sturgeon,  they've been genetically isolated since before t-rex existed

thank you! yes! finally a reasonable theory of evolution that is inclusive to native american lore regarding our origins. “we have always been here,” we just may not have always been sapiens.






1 
our concept of fixed species is all in our minds really . all 'species' are temporary forms either going extinct or evolving into another 'species'. life is one interwoven constantly mutating phenomenon that is better viewed as a whole/ collective in my unqualified opinion.

31





i like the term "grolar" better. the word fits better and actually sounds like the sound the bear makes.  🙂

1




in my bio book i remember it talked about how charles darwin observed two different species of birds who ended up mating with one another the offspring ended up with a different 'song' from the parents and the behavior was somewhere between the two. perhaps instead of looking at this from the perspective of "oh no an endangered species might go extinct sooner because it's breeding with another species" we should instead embrace that change. honestly humans are a huge reason this is happening anyways and animals are just trying to find a way to exist...another example the ca condor no longer need males to mate a can reproduce a sexually. overall nature is screaming thats change is coming things are getting warmer and they are just doing there best to adapt we should not interfere with this process and should let the 2 merge...plus the offspring will be stronger that gene pool larger. i say the same about other hybrids out there... what i don't like is the term 'purebred' that gives the notion that these wondrous creatures of evolution are a mistake, but they aren't. last comment why not give this developing species its own name instead of a half baked one that is incredibly stupid 🙄  interesting video overall though definitely food for thought.

1




let’s imagine that this is an evolutionary trait, in the negative timeline direction.  

similar to albinism, when species split, they end up moving away from the herd to survive.  eventually multiple herds will force out the albino, and at some point two can find each other and reproduce, and eventually dominant genetics replace the albinism.  

this would allow for a new “species” to evolve from multiple generations of survival, and allowing for two of the dominant genetic specimens to rebuild the bridge where the origin species can once again roam the earth.





adaptation at it's finest. polar bears were like: "the ice is melting and we all gonna die, lets mate with those that live in the other side!"

amazing and heartbreaking at the same time

hybrids aren't very common in mammals but are common in birds. very common in some families. check out the gull hybrids of western north america. there are a lot of them and one of the most common has parents which aren't even each other's closest relatives. the problem with "species" is that it is a human concept. in nature, species exist on a spectrum.





while we are still trying to figure out if human activity is leaning to increased rates of polar ice loss, we are still technically in an ice age, just the end of it. the ice was destined to disappear eventually, and so it's probably better for the polar bears if it happened now, rather than when they become incompatible





genetically speaking it is theoretically possible to make a human/chimpanzee hybrid that would be entirely sterile. while theoretically possible, ethically it has yet to be put into practice, hopefully it never is, as the offspring would be neither human nor chimp, it would be a horrible existence.


great video btw :)

thank u for sharing. wonderfully worded nd packed with mega interesting info...

bears are cute, but the disappearance of sea ice doesn't bother them they can swim for 2 weeks straight without rest and if you check their populations  today they are doing really really good despite the ice melting. the reason they are ending up south in alaskan cities is they were pushed off by a stronger bear's territory,  they end up in human settlements because of over population and need to be culled before they get out of control.





even some mammals: the southern short-tailed shrew (blarina carolinensis) has diploid numbers of 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41 and fundamental numbers of 41, 42, 43, 44 and 45.

i'm waiting for a hybrid octopus and dolphin. 
either the dolopus or octophin depending on what it looks like.





the hybrid may also gain genetic immunity from the diseases prevalent in each parent's niche, allowing it to better 'fit' in an ecologically dynamic landscape.
for instance, the circus could charge folks a buck to peek behind the curtain at 'em... you just don't get that kind of drawing power with your run-of-the-mill variety critter.





is "grizzly" being used as a shorthand for all three brown bear subspecies? it's surprising that a polar bear would travel so far inland to mate with a grizzly when the coastal browns would be far more accessible.





sorry, but who ever is responsible for naming the hybrid species, please, please keep working on those names and put in some effort... a pizzly must not stay...

1.1k





those bears are cute cuddly and super fun to play with..  you have nothing to fear from them in the wild.. in fact you should go camping in their habitat bring food for them.. you can hand feed them.. they might even shake hands like your pet dog.. they roll over and fetch to





the polar bear stuck on the ice floating  in the middle of the water had me wanting to push that ice near the next one.. he looked helpless





if you think about it the prehistoric animals had to have gotten smaller somehow. after a while they won’t be hybrid anymore.  there was once a bear as big as the one in the hobbit movie in prehistoric times





i was like, "wtf is a beluga school or narwhal school? and how does one just hang them on a wall?" [was listening without watching the video]
i guess she's saying "skull" but i damn sure heard "school"!

also, "pizzly" and "grolar" are not interchangeable. like most hybrids, with the only exception i'm aware of being the mule- the offspring of a male donkey and female horse, hybrid names depend on the sex of the parents and their species. the reason there are 2 names for a hybrid is to be specific about its parentage. for example, "liger" refers to the offspring of a male lion and female tiger; where "tigon", is the reverse pairing of a male tiger and female lion. 
so a "pizzly" is the offspring of a male polar bear and female grizzly. conversely, the 8 hybrids found to be the offspring of a single female polar bear have grizzly fathers and thus all 8 are "grolar bears". hybrids with names formed by combining the parents' species names begin with the father's species followed by the mother's. having 2 names reduces confusion and tells which genders were which in species pairings.

and, just for fun, the counterpart to a mule (and are less common than mules) is called a "hinney". that is sort of a mix of "horse" (just the "h"), and the name for a female donkey, which is called a "jenny". no idea why the "e" was replaced with an "i" for the naming though...





i feel like i knew all of this already, from my common sense and basic biology knowledge . it’s crazy how trapped in a box you can get with science, that it blinds you to intuition, and this is considered a new discovery.

1




i love science, and this was a fascinating video. when you got to the african cichlid portion and the diversity in the rift lakes of east africa, i was hooked!

40





1 
perhaps this means more seal species will form due less pressure from polar bears?





it sounds to me like we need to revise our definition of what a "species" is if certain animals can hybridize. also, to confirm: can the grolar bear create fertile offspring? i was wondering that the whole video, but you never confirmed it. perhaps the implication was there, but i wasn't sure.

1





1 
they should make a lot  more of tiger x lion and put them into the wild





creation scientists have been pointing out hybrids for decades. they really undermine the species definition but also open up lots of exciting adaptive possibility. hybrids explain how a diverse population can rapidly segregate into subspecies after a bottleneck. hybrids also allow fast adaptation during climate change. trying out new phenotypes and accessing genetic knowledge from that ancestral diverse population will allow them to survive in a changing world.

11





1 
it would be fascinating to study, i think hybrids are more common than we realize.  once a hybrid species has a large enough population it wouldn't require either of its parents species and could keep up their numbers on their own bring rise to a new species.





there have been cases of mules having offspring, although it is quite rare and it seems to only be mares that can be fertile sometimes

26





1 
very nice breakdown. thank you. subbed.


real science



grizzlies and polar bears are only two different species because of an ice age, makes sense that they'd merge back together as it ends.





in pakistans balochistan province, chiltan markhor ( mountain goat of chiltan mountain) is a hybrid specie of sindh markhor and suleman markhor, both sindh area and suleman are apart from each other, in between them chiltan mountain occurs, and chiltan markhor is only found in chiltan mountains, it has also three sub species which are also found in chiltan only





it's also bugs and insects that are becoming hybrid. my friend and i were out with our young children and we came across a bug it was an insect it had six legs but it had one head on each side and it could walk all directions i had never seen something like it and i haven't seen another one but that insect would walk forward and then walk forward the other way because of the two heads like something from the movie evolution  and it was completely crazy

im thankful to you  because for a long time i want to know why some hybrids can not breed.now i got the answer.i just love your work because everything you explain completely and i notice a lot of struggle and study of yours to make every video excellent. if you are seeing this , thanks again and keep it up👍

hold it. polar bears have been found as far south as south america because of riding ice rafts. they adapt very well to new environments because of their relatively high intellect. polar bears can eat anything, like brown bears.

2




we have coywolves where we're at. they're bigger meaner more aggressive coyotes that are more likely to group up. coyotes are generally solitary and sometimes they'll gang up. coywolves seem to have a propensity to do the pack thing more often and they're bigger and more aggressive.





narwhal/beluga hybrid are out there! one was caught in nunavut canada last summer





it sounds to me like the both of them found a way to escape extinction for a while.

i think its sad to see species disappearing but if you really think abt it its a natural process thats been happening since the beginning of time. were literally witnessing evolution happen right in front of us.

i’d like to see the biology of a cockroach and how it lives for so long
it’s my biggest fear but there’s a reason why it is

a mule is not merely the offspring of a horse and a donkey. it's the offspring of a mare (female horse) and a jack (male donkey). the offspring of a stallion (male horse) and a jenny (female donkey) is called a hinny not a mule. :) i remember it this way: mule (with an m) comes from a mare (with an m), and by extension, a jack. hinny (ending in y) comes from a jenny (ending in y) and by extension, a stallion.





these videos are so good, thank you :)





this makes sense. 

now i know why a nightfury can breed with a lightfury.





concise and scientific - thanks.





this video shows what a lot of scientist already know, life will find a way





"space flight measuring contest" was both amusing and accurate.

543





it is a common misunderstanding of evolution that there are only splits in lineages. to the contrary, many new species have developed as hybrids of (usually) closely related species.  in other words, there are not only branches, but anastomoses.





hunters have been explaining this type of animal hybrid for ages. this can’t be the first polar bear/grizzly granted there’s even been rumor of brown bears nd kodiak bears mating with grizzlies nd polar bears it’s insane





i saw a video about polar bear- grizzley bear crosses. it said that, when ice is little to none, polar bears have gone inland for food, and bred with grizzlies. later, when the ice returned, the crosses went back out, and nature selected again the palest ones as the most successful hunters, since they had the best camoflage against the snow, which lived, forming again, over time, the polar bears. this was thought to have enabled the survival of the polar bear over periods of global warming.

this means that hunting crosses needs to be banned, or polar bears will die out, because they won't hunt well in forests, because they are too obvious to prey, being so big and pale. they will all die of starvation, reliing on the crosses to carry their genes on, and if the crosses die out from human hunting, then the polar bear will die out with them!





i am a naturalist and i believe in conservation to certain extent. the problem i have with our current ideal of conservation is that we want everything to stay relatively the same as it is now and that is just not how nature works. and also some species naturally keep a lower number but that doesn't mean they are necessary endangered. we should try to minimize our effect on natural ecosystems and that means allowing species to go extinct and allowing for new species to emerge. that's the ideal of a naturalist. still i like your vid it's great, no shade.

1




i think a new name altogether. like, a horse + donkey is not a "horkey", it's a mule. the blending of names is too cutesy.





it should be called a grizzlar instead of a pizzly.

715





when it comes to coywolves theyve been interbreeding for a long time and producing successful offspring but it's thought that wolves had been hunted to the point where they don't have room to be choosey.

2




if this is the case of polar/grizzlies, is that the case with us? we've speciated somewhat, but not so far that we can't produce unfertile offspring.





even polar bears living in the arctic north are catching more action than some dudes living in downtown manhattan - shits crazy

this us exactly what i have been talking about when it comes to evolution, i always thought maybe the common view of evolution was looked at the wrong way, it makes a lot more sense that diversity come from breeding not natural selection.






1 
my area has the coywolf, which has red wolf blood in their genes, a species extinct in the wild in my area. so the coywolf is keeping their blood thriving for the time being.





grolar/pizzly is scariest bear around. imagine that. both parts strongest and smartest bear. absolutely scary





there is no coincidence but these hybrids are happening in our time now. this is most likely to do with the earth's magnetosphere. these hybrids are happening everywhere. i work outside and have seen some really cool mutations in the bees in my area






1 
i'm glad to see that the animal kingdom is becoming more progressive





i found this video very eye opening because my understanding of how species come about, is simply that it could only happen after thousands if not millsions of s.

diverse geography: diverging biology (aka speciation)
shrinking geography: converging biology (aka "hybridization")

i enjoyed the video though noticed no mention of coywolves. do you have any content regarding them?





i always wondered why cats and dogs never had a middle ground now i know lol





the dumbest thing that happened to the man who thought he shot the polar bear is the authorities took the animal and fined him!!!! yes, fined him.
if it were me i never would have brought it to light.





i'm so glad i found this channel today, only problem is i'm on a marathon 3 hrs so far lol. 😂





tiger muskies, which are a mix of musky and northern pike, are amazing naturally occurring fish that grow bigger faster, yet they don't live as long. they're the most beautiful fresh water fish

1 
maybe new to scientists, but i knkw a guy who grew up in the northwest territories and the existence of these hybrids is common knowledge. grizzly and polar bear territory has always overlapped





seems like the concept of 'species' will also have to go. it could make more sense to speak of 'lines' on somewhat fractally organized cladograms, and those lines might be typologized by their tendencies to split or to fuse, inner complexity, or whatever. some observable qualitative characteristics. and basically, thicker lines should be formed by thinner, lower level lines, all the way down to individuals and genes, and maybe something else. wouldn't it be nice to have a huge, scalable, and collectively editable graph for that 🤔





my first thought is to wonder if bear hybrids might survive better in the warming climate, and to really stretch it is it a sudden adaptation in response to climate






1 
grizzlys are op and polar bears too but a grolar is something else... it's like full diamond armor in real life





how did the last 2 minutes change into your morning routine with social media? interesting info before all that,  thank you





great film.
another example of natural hybridization can be seen in ne canada where eastern grey wovles seem to have produced fertile young with coyotes

4




our definitions of the divisions of living things is purely artificial. in nature there is no well defined barrier between the divisions, but rather they diffuse from one into another. and should the genetic differences not be too great, reproductively viable matings can occur (and will if given the chance).  hybrids are quite common, many have been taking place since the retreat of the last glaciers which geographically separated and isolated populations. under such situations the genetics of the population will "drift" away from that of the original population. once the physical barrier to mating has been removed this can increase the genetic variation of the resulting population. this is generally a good thing from a survival stand point. human are the result of several hybridizations.

5




apparently in the wild red wolves are breeding with coyotes and making a very adaptive hybrid.





what if this has been a driving force of evolution? if that's hasn't even been seriously considered then this could be hiding in plain sight all over the place





really great job on this.

1




i am so binge watching her videos rn lol





i’ve found it really interesting to dive into the ideas of species, subspecies, and race. 

though i realize that these are all flawed terms and they vary in their degree of scientific application, they can create interesting thought-paths when applied in varied scenarios. 

for example, are polars and grizzlies just different “races” of bears?

4




red deer/sika deer hybrid are common place in wicklow ireland and are fertile





if a) species are defined based on the ability of their populations to breed and produce viable, fertile offspring
and b) a 'hybrid' is defined as the offspring of two separate species
and c) the offspring of two given populations is viable and fertile
then d) those populations are of the same species
and e) those offspring are not 'hybrids'





i'm surprised that the divergence of polar bears from the common stock with brown bears goes back as far as 150 thousand s...


it would be interesting to see research on any "ancient" dna that might be discovered from brown bears and polar bears from different interglacial periods to see if there were a bear equivalent of our neanderthal and denisovan hybrid ancestry.





i’ve always thought this is how evolution worked. it’s a same about a polar bears but if they’re nee hybrids are better adapted well that’s how natural selection and evolution work and we have to accept that





maybe one of the new evolutionary traits that animals are developing is based on the fact that we are pushing so many of them towards endangerment and extinction that this evolutionary beneficial thing happened to the reproductive systems and is allowing them to explore a broader range of mates to ensure survival of the species





hybrids is what helps with evolution at times, i mean, look at humans. we mixed with neanderthals, denisovans, and two other unnamed hominids. the pizzly is just a start of a new line of bear that will generically diverge into a new species. honestly, i think hybridism is over looked alot of the history of evolution. so doesn't that mean pizzly would have 'two' common ancestors 

domesticated arctic dogs have 1.4% taiymer wolf in their genetics, were other dogs dont. wolfdogs are hybrids, some people try to argue they are the same and not a hybrid. it is, just like a coydog. not to mention the constant hybridization of plants. i have seen photos of a tarantula hybrid of p.irminia and p.cambridgei, though it was sterile. actually, now that i remember, hybridization was a huge touchy subject in the tarantula hobby. lol

79





then there is the polar bear found in the artic and the antarctic. 
which suffers severe mood swings
and has relations with both male and female bear.
it is a bi polar, bipolar, bi, polar bear

2




it’s funny listening to her talk about the potential outbreak of hybrid animals and the same thing is happening with humans to the point of everybody being mixed ultimately





well done. enjoyed the video.





wild hybrids aren't more common, we're just more aware now of this phenomena





the real question is should we be a lot more active in spreading wild species around the place (intelligently of course) to speciate and deepen diversity.





can we just admire how cute all these animals are

...it's so strange that people don't find this disturbing and sad for the world and for future generations (not like it's going to impact us, right?)






best zoology channel i love  the contents.





a liger is pretty much my favorite animal. it's like a lion and a tiger mixed. bred for it's skills in magic.

6




this isn’t strange but exactly how we get all the different animals now.
canada geese and snow geese have been breeding for s.
wolves and coyotes too coy-wolf.

animals are starting to roam outside their areas again and no are remixing

1




the first ever hybrid bear in the wild... and it was shot to death.
humanity is such a genius.





i remember telling my teacher how i thought animals mating with other animals would create new species and evolve and she argued with me saying that’s not how that works. now i wish i could send this shit to her





i would assume that evolution could happen faster with consistent hybridization





imagine being one of the top predators across the world and being named a pizzly.

1




i have a dog that i adopted from kuwait. the vet that found her said that she seems to be a mix between the general saluki mutt of the desert and a desert fox. most people believe that dogs and foxes can’t breed. breeders in europe have been cross breeding doxes for a couple hundred s. mine just happens to be an example of it happening in the wild.

9





this is so cool and tragic at this same time 😭





wow, almost like life finds a way to adapt to changing climates!





yes the african cichlid 🤦🏿‍♂️ i had all kinds of hybrids after awhile. and every male had several of there own females but chose to cut in on each other's dance anyways 🤔🤣😂🤣





these videos are so awesome.





my new favorite science channel !!





i've wanted to learn about this for so long. great video! but i still don't understand: if different species can make viable offspring, what makes a species vs. different strains of the same species?

3





i don't know why but 4:27 "donkey dad" had me giggling uncontrollably 🤣

there have been evidence of a wolf and coyote may have bred in the wild, even though they are normally enemies.





i think we can use ram pumps to solve the energy crisis. first we build a hollow cylindrical tower out at sea, to a depth of say 1100m. the tower is open to the air at the top and has a sealed base at the bottom. we drill a hole about 20m below the surface and feed water into the tower. the water falls down a pipe for about 200m where it powers a turbine that is connected to an electricity generator. we collect the water and drop it down a pipe for another 200m to another turbine. we do this twice more until we are getting electricity from four generators.
we then drop the water another 200m to power a turbine which drives a cog that is geared to turn a disc at the base of the tower. the waste water from the last turbine starts to collect at the bottom of the tower creating a shallow reservoir that we need to pump out.
the rotating disc at the base of the tower has cams along its edge. these cams are used to push pistons outwards. these pistons are in cylinders built into the wall in a circular formation. the cylinders are sealed at the interior side apart from where a piston rod enters to push the piston outward. the outside of the piston head is exposed to the deep sea water. 
the cam will push the piston outward against the high pressure deep sea water. an inlet pipe will take water from our shallow reservoir which will be pulled into the space created in the cylinder, behind the piston head. when the cam releases the piston, the low pressure water inside the cylinder will be the only thing pushing the piston out against the high pressure deep sea water.
this is when the system acts as a ram pump.
the piston will be forced inward and will force the low pressure water back out through the inlet pipe toward the reservoir. the inlet pipe will now act the same as a waste pipe in a ram pump and the flowing water will shut a waste valve. the remaining water in the cylinder will be forced through a check valve into a pipe and upwards to the surface.
the larger the diameter of the tower, the more cylinders that can be built into the wall at the base of the tower.
i realise that the ram pump cylinder will pump more of its water back into the reservoir than it sends to the surface but we can always add more cylinders to the system. we can even put another layer of cylinders above the original ones as ram pumps still work underneath shallow water.
i think we should be able to pump water upwards at the same rate that it falls into the bottom of the tower and so keep the reservoir nice and shallow.
now, if i understand the maths correctly, we might only be able to pump the water near to the surface. in that case, we can pump the water into a reservoir tank (inside the tower) and use the electricity generated by the first turbine to pump out the tank.
this will leave us with 3 generators worth of electricity for every tower built.
would this work? everyone, please comment.

"having reproductive organs that don't fit together" -  shows gorilla and hamster

i can't stop laughing!!





i feel so much better since i stopped following everything that happens through news !!










can we talk about how the hunter shot what he thought was a polar bear?

201





i'm so stoned right now. this was a massive ride for me from start to finish

186





actually. polar bears do better with less ice, to a point of course. their prey has less ice to use as a land form so they have to use more land which is better for the bears.





nature adapts what can we expect. i'm hoping we find a mammoth or something new.





no need to worry grolars in the north will lean more towards their polar ancestry since the ones that lean more to grizzlies in appearance have more trouble surviving successfully in the north.





maybe with the polar bear and grizzly bear nature mating, its mother nature's natural instinct way of a species to continue to survive in the warming world

1





7




so they all of a sudden change  "prizzly" to "pizzly"...

because when i did research on bears. this hybrid was referred to as a prizzly bear. but  grolar bear sounds cool.





my theory is that we are having more hybrid animals because they are trying to survive while slowly becoming extinct.





tbh i thought this was how so many different species came about anyways i understand evolution but think about it we got some weird animals long as it’s kinda in the same family it can produce over time make whole new species everywhere like a lion and bird can’t mate but two different birds species can cuz they have the same biological concept and make a whole new species of birds





once you grizzly/brown thats all youll be down for. reminds me of got when they were in the frozen north on how to keep warm scene "effing is best, fighting is 2nd and walking is 3rd" and queue the "theres is no other of my type" ....well you gotta work with what you got.  or love the one your with not the one you want.





the gorilla + field mouse caught me off guard





it's all fun and games until centipedes start breeding with mosquitoes.

369





there was a cool unique bear hybrid roaming in the wild. 
what happened to it?
a guy shot it of course.





it's hard to hear that someday in the future pure polar bears would become extinct. theyre just so cute man.





"grolar bear" is a much cooler name than a "pizzly bear"





funny thing they went to count the polar bear population and they found there was more than before lol





''...a trophy hunter shot what he thought was  a polar-bear''  
well, poaching has become normal.





can you imagine how mesmerized that grizzly dad was when he comes across a female that looks like no other he's seen! i bet he was head over heals in love 😍

the cychalid chart had live bearing tooth carp on it (siamese fighters) not native to the great lakes of africa.





that’s amazing how electric cars can adapt so fast

bears are so playful in the videos, you'd forget they could be dangerous





fun fact: signs point to the yeti being a hybrid bear.

20





i thought polar bears were grizzlies that moved farther north, changed a little then turned white.





over here in colorado we have this hybrid animal call manbearpig. it's half man, half bear, and half pig





are you saying if there is a chromosome match… 

a tasmanian devil and a cucumber both have 14 

a koala and a kangaroo both have 16.. (that would be terrifying, a hopping bear that could max out at 70km/h and jump 6 feet into the air that will give anything it comes into contact with chlamydia. 

otters and racoons both have 38, the same as tigers and lions 🤔 

the american black bear also has 74 along with the polar and brown. 

78 is quite interesting and involves a lot of the dog breeds. dingos in australia have bred with all sorts of domestic dog breeds





sadly coywolf is not mentioned. possibly one of the most successful hybrid of the modern time.

the question remains... why a trophy hunter kills a polar bear when it's super endangered?





did you know that we already have a hybrid human? bear grills!

honestly a grizzly polar bear hybrid is actually overpowered

great channel! i really want more!

real science




1 
some of the animal hybrids are the product of 2 species that are more dissimilar than humans and chimpanzees, which makes you think that humanzees might actually be possible.





1:44if the adaptations of the two declining species combine it widens the genetic pool and adaptation variation although the hybrids or not as fertile with enough i think the breeding will become more fertile in time






1 
the answer for the bears is easy.  the ice caps are melting because we are still coming out of the last ice age and the polar bears are moving to the landmass coast away from the ice.   which allows them to encounter grizzly bears.   the ice will be gone eventually but the good news is the animals on the ice are not stupid, they know when to leave their habbitat. the bad news is we may see pizzly bears and polar bears





3:36 and 9:44 both made me crack up 😃





"space flight measuring contest"
i am surprised no one applauded you/your writer for this gem.





it made me feel like hybrid will be able to reproduce at some point and that’s how species evolve into another species.

so we're very likely to see some pumans on farms in norfolk pretty soon





i love how you managed to diminish human responsability on these forced crossbreeds. do not make it sound nice, do not disguise it. it is not something remarkable it is sad, every  more and more species are endagered directly because of the human hand.

this has probably happened many times just not actually noticed till then





you just can't run from both let a lone a hybrid. if it sees you you can't outrun, outswim, or outclimb it






1 
to have a better chance for both species to continue to live on

1




maybe breeding like this is how evolution always has been.
first, a species evolves into two as they split paths
later, somehow and sometime those two species meet again and breed
then a new species adapted to new things appears, and then it all repeats again.

people joking about flying spiders
me:have you heard of brazilian flying spiders?

you guys know that flying brazilian spiders exist right? 
brazil is covered with flying spiders every 
they think those are scary heard of the flying toe biting roach?
also called giant water bug it can pierce skin 
it is extremely painful
there are even more where those came from you should see flying spiders mating season is is insane
it is chaos there are way more creepy crawlers that we don’t know if the giant water bug and flying brazilian spider mate
they would make a giant water bug that lives in the water with wings can spin webs and pierce through skin it would be horrifying





abc island bears have a genetic structure that relates them not only to brown bears but polar bears as well. they aren't a "pizzly". theyre a product of an isolated population of polar bears interbreeding with the more common brown bear population.. they're not as extreme a hybrid like a "pizzly' or "liger" but they are hybrids and they do reproduce. 
life, uh, finds a way.





fascinating,💛🌎💛!  this is  illuminating and deep ecologically hopeful in the way that the new wild by fred pearce , is.





nothing wrong with this. it’s happened throughout history. it’s called survival.





in 2014 they found a live hybrid of two african antelope; the waterbuck and red lechwe





fyi: most modern homo sapiens are descendants of hybrids

482





it just like dog breeding if you breed a husky and golden retriever you get a golfer ian. breed enough golberians and they become pure bred golberians. now breed a golberians with a shiba inu and you get a golbershinu or that’s what i would call the mix between a golberians and a shiba inu.





does this mean i can have a polarbear dog like naga from the legend of korra? or a platypus bear? lmaoo






1 
why was the hunter after a polar bear? i couldn't get passed that.





i wonder why ligers are so much larger than tigons? do pizzlys and grolars show any dimorphism too? how about coywolves/woyotes?





in my best jason segel voice "what the fuck is a hybrid animal?"





brown bears appear to be able to cross breed not only with polar bears, but also with american black bears and asian black bears. genetic analysis shows that all living bears except the panda and spectacled bear are likely fully genetically compatible with each other.

5





so if hybrids cant mate with regular animals, could they mate with fellow hybrids? could a zonkey mate with another zonkey?





maybe this is another piece of the evolution puzzle we are missing.





i live in saskatchewan canada and i have been told that the mule deer and the whitetail deer will hybrid i do not know if this is true and whether these animals can reproduce also i have been told that the wolf in the dog will hybrid and i do not know if this is true or if they can reproduce perhaps someone can tell me





if scientists seriously thought that hybrids existing in the wild wouldn't change much then how can the predict how the de-extintion of animals will change things?





i'm a hybrid myself. i'm irish, scottish, russian, british, norwegian, scandanavian, and two native americans.cherokee and chenooke.

hybrids is one way for species to escape full extinction.  probably the same thing happened to the neanderthals

141





amazing how they "discovered" the bear...





narrator: "polar bears are struggling to survive."
polar bears: current population 6x original 1950s count (with a 27% increase in 10 s) "oh, really?"

1 
we have never had more polar bears in existence than we have today.






1 
is it possible that hybrids could explain some of the missing  links of some species on the tree of life?

1





1 
one female polar bear is into grizzlies and you've got a whole new species.





polar bears and grizzly bears split fairly recently. because of this they have enough commonality that they can successfully mate, similar to neanderthal and homo sapiens, both are cousins and not separated species

3




we just want elephant/mammoth hybrids already





imagine breeding a wolverine and a honey badger. hahahaha

2




i kindergarten teacher way back laughed at me when i told her about prizzlies. then she apologized the next day when she learned they were true





the definition of the term "species" is a very flexible human convention and has been changed many times in the last 150 s.





like ian malcolm said "life will find a way".





we're getting closer to seeing the animals of avatar: the last airbender

1k





if there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. life breaks free, it expands to new territories, and crashes through barriers painfully, maybe even dangerously, but, uh, well, there it is. ... ian malcolm: life will find a way.





i thought hybrid animals sounded like it was going to be something like wolf/eagle  orbear/snake





there's a cart before the horse idealization in the "reasons" for hybridization. there's no driving force to make adaptations more suitable for an environment, individuals that have better adaptations are more fit and pass along those genes more often than less adapted ones.





man the sponsorship came out of nowhere, i was so confused for a few seconds 😂😂😂

nature always finds a way





they think "the lonliest whale in the world" may be some sort of weird hybrid. either that or it's a deaf humpback.

isn't it be more likely the polar bear would eat a grizzly?










wow. amazing. bears mate with other bears!





oh my god it's like they are evolving. this must be the first time in history that bears have evolved.

i use to live on a farm in massachusetts. we had these coyote-wolf hybrids killing our chickens and goats. they were fast and i only saw them twice(ofc without my rifle). i shot one and i kid you not he ran off but i never saw those bastards again

trophy hunter thought he'd shot a polar bear... are they not an endangered (protected) species already?





the reason this happens is due to human interference.





i wonder what other weird hybrids are out there that we don't know about 🤔

11





1 
if you mate a snake with a hedgehog , you get a barbed wire.
if you mate a donkey with a spider, you get a donkey climbing walls.
chuck norris mated a calamari, it gave birth to steven seagal.





speciation in action so freaking cool!





wait...are you saying that some animals mate with whatever they can?  that's amazing!  lol.





noticed they didn't tell you that they put that poor guy in jail and charged him a hundred thousand dollars because he thought he was shooting a polar bear which she was licensed to shoot but he ended up shooting that he had no knowledge and they still put him in jail that's messed up





some mules are fertile. it's rare, but i've heard of mules mating with horses.





“life…uh…finds a way”

we’re hybrids ourselves

134





it's not either a pizzly or a grolar. scientific convention when naming hybrid animals is to place the sire's name first, so it is unambiguously a grolar according to the information in the video. you'd think a channel named "real science" would be aware of this basic fact.





if a polar bear goes closer to equator will it eventually evolve back into a a regular bear





6:39 aw this polar bear is so incredibly cute





who knows, maybe in the future, centaurs and minotaurs will roam the earth 😍






1 
a white polar bear mated with two dark furred grizzly bears? i'm sure there's a website dedicated to videos depicting such things





the coywolf is an interesting hybrid.

65





has it occurred to anyone that  "nature" may not be at all concerned with human ideas of species and speciation? it seems that the prime directive of life may be the propagation of life including the often misguided but well meaning "species" like humanity.






1 
i think it makes sense that these animals are instinctively cross breeding to overcome their low numbers and avoid inbreeding.  “life, uh uh uh finds a way…”  dr. ian malcolm





so avatar the last airbender had it right. can’t wait to see lion turtle 🐢





this evolutionary mechanic is almost certainly responible for the development of the modern human species through the hybridization of various archaic human species in africa

1




pizzlies sounds like the perfect name for a new brand of chips lol

1




"pizzly" is an unfortunate appellation. perhaps a name more characteristic of this hybrid will suggest itself.

43





i can just imagine them smoking a cigarette after the deed and grizzly turns to polar and says "let's keep this a secret"

5





finally, it has been proved. "love has no boundaries"

3




do not i repeat do not, underestimate the the polar bear. he's been around for a long time!





news sucks and is pretty much always politically motivated... i'd much rather start my day with real science videos and learn about nature! love these videos!





some mules for example have been able to reproduce not being completely sterile





9:55 "diets that consist of... carry-on" i'm sorry i know it's just a different pronunciation but the idea of a grizzly munching through everyone's bags on a flight while they all sit there terrified is hilarious to me

55





with these finds who knows what other unknown species are out there





many if not most animals are under extinction thread.  perhaps this hybridization is part of reason for rapid species diversitization seen in fossil record when ecosystems change drastically





is the ice that’s preventing them from getting through the same ice that shrunk 15% every decade since the 70s asking for a friend





alright… i got to say it because nobody else has. we are moving a step closer to a world like avatar!!!! lol hopefully, bending becomes a thing too





awesome, grizzlies don’t actively hunt humans, but polars do, so that’s awesome, a super bear that hunts humans. fantastic.





"....shot what he thought was a polar bear...." i'm sorry, aren't we trying to save those?

549





that grizzly male is my hero.





nature is perfect and will continue with or without us perfectly





imagine a hybrid of a fly and mosquito it's the end of the world

1




carrion is not pronounced “carry-on”
its “carry-en” the on is pronounced like the em in system. this is why its spelled the way it is rather than being spelled carryon or caryon which are close to crayon. that ion is important you see.





we need to start mixing politicians an see what type of hybrid we can produce





the...space flight measuring contest...i see what you did there! 😂

p.s. awesome, informative video as always!

5




this makes more sense with history.





while the biological species concept is still taught in high school and undergrad it has largely been abandoned in professional circles as there are far too many exceptions to it, and, additionally, it doesn't take into account asexually reproducing species, of which there are many.

it's also worth noting that in very rare instances mules and hinnys are fertile and can produce fertile offspring.  it's uncommon, but it has been documented.

hybridization as an evolutionary strategy makes a lot of sense. one species adapting to changes is slow and can be easily wiped out by sudden environmental changes. if one species splits apart into maybe a dozen subspecies that each adapt to a specific environment, if a disaster strikes they can interbreed and create hybrids with several specific adaptations and have a better change of surviving. even though the specialized subspecies may disappear, their genes will be passed on.





"don't call me donkey doug, call me donkey dad."
"ok, donkey dad."
"naw that's whack..... call me donkey doouuugg"





do not mix these bears together. i’m telling ya now if you make a grizzly and polar bear mix that means the polargrizly would most likely be able to go south into territory it’s not from and will displace the natural habitat.





narluga is a neat name, but is it just me, or does belwhale sound a lot cooler!

22




i bet the first grizzly that ever saw a polar bear was like, "wow! look at that white fur! now that's sexy!" the rest is history.





while this is interesting it makes me sad that the bears are being forced to encounter each other due to climate change. i will be absolutely devastated if we cant figure out how to save the polar bears.

3:36 had me laughing.





uhm. there's no shortage of polar bears. folks in the north say there has never been more polar bears. as far as the "grolar" bear, these are not different species, they are both of "bear" type. and, this is not a sad story, just real life revealing itself to scientist's blind eyes.





if they are from the same family it can work. why do people make this as if it’s impossible 🤷🏻





ligers are pretty much my favorite animal. bred for their skills in magic.

7




pizzly is a pretty unfortunate name.  grolar is weird too, but it sounds better.





i remember when this first happened the guy was gonna get in trouble for shooting the wrong  species





what's interesting is it's happening to humans too, interracial parents with biracial kids. i'm one of them. half asian and half latino (korean and paraguayan)





love the show





this is why we need to change rhe definition of a species. there are exceptions to the rule, so the rule doesn't work. i always thought the definition of "the can mate and the offspring can as well" was stupid. they're still different creatures. we either need to consider them the same species if they can create viable offspring, or decide that different species can make viable offspring





your not losing polar bears. their just changing their wardrobe.

11





this is insane!!!





grolar bears are a slightly more terrifying thought.





one day pure blood animals would become rarities and hybrids will be the new common





i cracked at the gorilla and hamster mating





why was the trophy hunter going after polar bears to begin with? are they not already struggling enough?





actually, the polar/brown bear hybrids go back 100's of s.

17





1 
as humans continue to expand our territory, hybrids are going to continue to pop up.





it’s all fun and games til the chimera ants find out about this one

1




if you think about it it could be tgat they are mixing on purpose as their offspring may survive better for the changing climate it’s kinda like evolution things will always change over time to meet the environmental changes and the whole infertility part may slowly go away making them be able to breed once the environment and mix match up perfectly. just my thoughts





eastern coyotes are viable hybrids that have existed for over a hundred s and have existed for so long, they have become their own species. sooooo yeah, viable hybridization in nature is completely possible at any moment in time.





this is happening with humans too lol 😂🤣💯

1




imagine if before dinosaurs went extinct...
and 69 million s later when humans went extinct, a new type of sentient creature thought polar bears were monsters and try to bring them back from being extinct like how we like revived dinosaurs.

4




it will be an animal much more suitable for survival especially for the polar bear





life finds a way✨





2:50 not sure how you could be isolated physically but not genetically





finally, denisovans and neanderthal - originally thought impossible, but now a proven fact. i always knew this anyway for 50 s- you can see it in the scandanavian and german facial features

1




it’s crazy that we made a hybrid human/monkey… scary…





that was the smoothest transition to an ad i've ever heard. i didn't even know it was happening at first.

8




respectfully queen, there was an opportunity to say "this was not your average bear"





this is what the yeti was! these two animals only ent their  separate ways since the end of the last ice age!





some female hybrids can have babies, female liger and female tigon can have liliger, litigon, l3liger, tiliger, titigon, they exist. so they are a 2nd and 3rd generation. 

maybe , 3 o more generation can breed between them and made new species between lion and tiger (not liger and tigon, but a new species who have baby with female and male together) 

i hope you understand me, because english is not my language.





not sure why something i learned about in the early 90s is new? she compares a mule to horse breeding as equivalent to polar bears and grizzleys. might as well compare raccoons to pandas...





what do you get when a rhinoceros and and elephant mate?

elephino (hell if i know)

1




"a web of life." dang... deleuze might be right about metaphysics.

37




actually polar bear populations are growing and have been since the hunting ban.  enough so that a few locations are having to hunt them. to lower their population.





life always finds a way!
bring on the t ibex!





i think if a hybrid baby mates back with its parent. then u get new offspring that pass the genes.





nature always finds a way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!





excellent. nature finds a way.

1




doesn't grolar bear sound more representative of fierceness than "pizzly" bear?  pizzly is zilly--er, silly!

12




as the artic ice is melting. polar bears are trying hard to save their species. this hybridization may save the polar bear genomes from extinction.





common guys don't be racist! let the brown bois enjoy the white gals without thinking about diluting the race.





edit: damn the ending made me tear up. it's insane how one single species can eradicate and change all other on the planet without really trying.





humanity has been crossing those lines for decades now, what has it done for humanity?.

1




warming climates drive arctic species further south because melting sea ice means less "land" to stand and hunt on, at the same time the warmer climate opens northern latitudes to warmer weather species. similar species hybridize, and hybrids that aren't quite suited for true arctic conditions are set to take the stage because it allows them to bring adaptations from their warmer cousins to the warming arctic which might allow them to better survive the wetter conditions or leave them altogether.

hybridization might actually be a way for two similar species to sidestep into a completely new niche and eventually evolve enough to become their own species, a way to avoid the threat of extinction by completely stiring up the gene pool which might lead to more random mutation which might in turn lead to better adaptability to this new climate. sure hybrids usually can not reproduce but if you have a large number of hybrids (and it is driven by natural pressures such as climate change/food scarcity/habitat reduction) you only need 1 to be born fertile for the beginnings of a new hybrid species. and while we get hybridization often enough to classify these hybrids, changing evolutionary pressures can drive hybridization up through being pushed into each other territories or there simply aren't enough of their own species around. and genetics are a lottery, in order for the hybrids to get good mutations to help them reproduce there has to be a lot of attempts. you have to play the lottery to win it, more hybrids means more chances for mutations. obviously some hybrids have better chances then others. honestly im amazed mules work at all, like how lucky do you have to be at genetic lottery to have different numbers of chromosomes and really the only notable common defect is infertility





this means these two bears are the same species by definition. they are subspecies of the same species.

1




evolution, polar bear grizzly hybrid would be able to survive outside the polar regions of the polar bear.  kind of common sense, no basically common sense.

24




the grolar bear is the hybrid offspring of the grizzly and polar bear.
 
the pizzly bear is the hybrid offspring of the grizzly and polar bear.

what's the difference? 
if the father is a grizzly bear it's called grolar and 
if the father is a polar bear it's called pizzly. 
                             pretty cool right?










who else thought they were talking about spirit bears?





according to science, polar bears and grizzly bears are now the same species.





when humans get upset at nature for doing things its always done





this explains what is happening to europe and its people very well.

1 
great senior project.  good thoughts.





frankly i am amazed anybody is able to fuck and breed with anybody. i'm talking across all species.
getting 2 individuals to want to mate with each others, and find the optimal time and place to do it, given all the countless pressures against them: getting eaten by someone else, work schedules, privacy, physical act of doing it is awkward.





so the female polar bear has several kids from various grizzly bears?





we wont see polar bears dissappear, they have gone from 6 000 individuals to 32 000 individuals in the last 15 s or so ...





i wanna know what a human and chimp hybrid looks like. lets make it happen





so, in a way to me this seems like a form of evolution

10





1 
yeah okay i’m waiting for the disney pixar movie about a stoic, somewhat stuck up polar bear who meets an optimistic , down for anything grizzly bear and the two fall in love as they go on a journey to save their homes.





isn't the name based on which parent was the father and which the mother?

as far as i know:
grolar bear = grizzly dad + polar mom
pizzly bear = polar dad + grizzly mom






1 
gorilla + hamster would be a brutality. 🤣





how would you classify species now? the definition given @2:45 would mean a host of separate species recognize we recognize would be the same species. humans have been isolated on islands or separate continent for how many thousand s?





hybrids may give hope to the return of original species in the future.





nature is always evolving has been from the start of life on this planet

61





grizzlies are not being pushed north due to development. at least not in canada. i don't think you understand how sparsely populated the canadian north is relative to it's size.  also, we have been told that polar bear populations are about to be wiped out for a long time now and it isn't happening.  i think the possibility exists that climate change could really hurt them, but it simply hasn't happened yet.  according to the wwf, populations are just fine.





i like ligers because of their skills and magic.





what if, a horse and a donkey mate, and then a horse and a horse mate, and then chimerization happens? would only the horse gametes pass their genetics along?





love the polar bears!

2




i've heard the sasquatches have been mating with meadow muffins up in the northwest and that's..... err.... well there you go





i’m on team grolar for the name of the hybrid

29





1 
that's why the ark didn't have to have all species just species of a kind.

1





1 
so i would like to know where you got your information that polar bear populations are on the decline?  there are many reports that show polar bear populations are increasing.

1




2:17 they’re bred for their skills in magic





i wanna see a bearverine combo. then i think we should graft a rocket onto its back. ultimate attack machine. think about it. you try to stop a rocket equipped bearverine from getting what it wants. good luck.





3:36 i dont know why i laughed so heard !





pizzlies will disappear too just like the neaderthals, when the polar bears disappear pizzlies will mate with just grizzlies and eventually the amount of polar bear ancestry in those descendants will be minuscule.

3




love has no boundaries 😂





you can hybrid some pythons and thry are able to breed and look badass





hats off to that grizzly





a wonder how far invetrofertilization has come in the animal kingdom, as to when there is a limit on the number of species, the animals are near extinction. albeit the number of human beings focused on this ‘type’ of work, it is important for human collaboration to occur, as to the sharing of ideas and assistance towards the efforts. the most recent report of the extinct 🦏 rhino and other animals has to encourage human eyes and minds open to new solutions, thus no one finds themselves with a hand count or one or two animals who are both tired and old, later dying, gone extinct. why it matters if the earth has animals on it? sure seems it would be very disappointing if the human species went to the local zoo or traveled through the safari, and there was nothing to see, no animals or even so a select specific species. any of the animals, gone extinct, it would be upsetting, to tell kids they will never see another type of animal in their lifetime, in the future, seems upsetting. animal preservation is important, overpopulation no, but the right balance of creation/procreations, is. 🐣🐥.





i wonder if 2 specie's with 99% same dna can interbreed?





so were getting gen 2 animals aswell. i'm quite attached to gen 1.

6




wow that ad transition was incredible





hybrids are beautiful. look at humans cross breeding race by attraction not even thinking of creating hybrids with awesome eye and skin tone colors.





"nature uhhh finds a way"

can’t wait to see ligers running wild





in the southern usa, there are hybrids humans/donkeys.





talking about making things fit, like what malcom from jurassic park says.

very interesting documentary. humans have an obligation to preserve all animals that we can. it is our duty to do what ever it takes to preserve these animals. we share a planet with them and as a result must help perpetuate all species of these animals. 
plain and simple we must do our part.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!





scientists told us that cialis would work it’s way into the environment.

"life, uhh, finds a way." - jeff goldblum





so as far as i understand grizzlys  and polar bears are actually by the biological definition the same species and pizzlys/grolars are not hybrids





wait she said now there’s a polar bear or grizzly but then said i hybrid of both? so it’s both





that two headed horse hybrid in 2:22 is wild!

5





this is very exciting :)





gorilla and hamster: no

i screemed! 😂😂😂😂 bro, just imagine! i can’t lol





octopi. the plural of octopus is octopi.





only reasonable explanation: polar bear must've watched an episode of keeping up with kardashians.





“life finds a way” 
life: well yes but not for genetic crossbreed freaks

hybridization occurs alot more in nature than man realizes, when it is brought to our attention we gasp in shock.

5




in central asia, minimally 50% of the human is either asian nor european, rather than eurasian. hence, hybrid human race has always been common let alone hybrid animals.





the potential for narluga was missed. smh





4:14 in this case, they have another major problem to produce offsprings because both the shown horse and the shown donkey are male 🤭





i wonder if dogman n sasquatch have ever mixed? i’m positive we have with sasquatch.
so yeah nine times outta ten in the wild it has!!

there are more polar bears today than ever. they are highly adaptable and live well on land. they are becoming a menace to siberian villages. they can hunt seals without polar ice.

1




the inuit refer to them as nanulak bears, which sounds cooler. i think ima call them that.





my analogy from this is what if two different species do have the capability of mating would that mean that it’s capable of us being able to evolve and mate with a different species as well since polar bears r going extinct evolution was involved. chromosome don’t match up once there a hybrid but what if 2 hybrids mate then the chromosomes would match up exactly giving the animal capability of having or producing baby’s










noooooooo........
i love polar bears 😭😭😭
i hope they don't go extinct.....





can't wait to watch this later tonight! giving it a like because i know that it will be amazing ❤

7




i wonder what in the dna told scientist  which species was the father and which was the mother?





it's already happening with humans as well.
just go to a furry convention and you'll see all types of human-animal hybrids.





life finds a way to survive.





i was first shocked to hear that hunting is still practised in north america . maybe due to less human awereness and govt policies their grades in animal care is so less.





i smiled when i hear "donkey dad".





grolar sounds like a pokemon, pizzly sounds like a sound you make when you take a wizz.

115





the skull you showed when you said "neanderthals and denisovans" was neither neanderthal, nor denisovan (as far as we can guess).





if polar bears were endangered, 🏆 hunters wouldn't be able to buy a license/tag.





ian malcolm - “life finds a way”





can we all agree that a polar and grizzly bear hybrid is the most terryrifing shit ever, of course except for the satan bird that are the cassowaries





we humans really had a big impact on climate change which is also the reason why animals of all species are suffering and being extinct. it's a very sad reality. ,😔😑





my inner russian: bears look so cute and huggable...
me: 😨

37





1 
people spend so much time and effort saving pandas from extinction even though they clearly want to die, and ignore these beautiful apex bears that’s really sad. hybrids? abomination. save their habitat let them live





i loved this video so much. everything was so well explained and you gave us a really broad view of the topic while still going in-depth enough into each part to learn something interesting :d

1

real science



so the next step in the formation of new species is via human caused factors





do mules go in heat or try to mate?





can we melt the polar ice caps without everyone going crazy now?





nice, was just now looking for something interesting to watch!

71




evolution right before eyes✌🏾🙏🏾





what is causing wild animals to hybridize?
well, if you take a look at the timeline of their appearances, i think all points to a single culprit... 
tinder!
😝





i see alot of hybrid fish in the medeteranian at the last few s





not all hybrids are sterile the advantage is that it’s a leap forward in evolution





so do we change the definition of species or are grizzlies and polar bears the same species





grizzly and polar bears: you can't stop the beat.

love is love, guys

18




what makes me sad about this video - is that, in the beginning, it's mentioned that some hunter 'shot' one of these bear hybrids. 
this chance of hybridisation might be the polar bear's only way of preserving its dna for the time being (while we're currently throwing the planet on the dung heap), with the opportunity to re-speciate at a later date (should we finally pull our fingers out and start doing something to reverse environmental damage).
however, you can bet that hunters, who really don't need to nail another head on their walls, will now be turning their attention to getting the latest 'fashion' in trophies.
these hybrids should be protected by international law and any hunters caught killing or maiming them should pay heavily for their actions.

1 
that was one brave male grizzly





we've been seeing water snake and cotton mouth varieties in tx

1




atleast we have a succesor that still serves the biological niche of the polar bear and looks like one





insane some dork would come up with pizzly for a giant powerful creature like the larzy.

1




someone is going to say, "can't wait for catgirl hybrids"

33





ain't  no difference than people having interacial fun happens all the time!😁😜👍





when they looked at the genes of wisents which are european bisons. they find out that wisents have only 10 percent bison genes. the rest are cow genes. so wisents have a similar history als pizzly bears. compare pictures of wisents with pictures of bisons and cows and you will see that a wisent looks like a hybrid.





terrified of the thought of humanzees. 😂

scientific method:  kind of forces you back to the drawing board on your theory, when your observations disprove your theory.





as long as there’s no mosquito centipede mix i can remain on earth





sooner or later were gonna have turtleduck, cant wait to tell zuko about this

modern man is a hybrid from our precursors as well!





hybrid adaptation is part of evolution and survival

ian malcolm said it... " life finds away"





this is mind blowing. pizzly bears





i’m a hybrid. my mums white and dads jamaican. us humans call it “mixed race” 🤣🇬🇧🇯🇲





so first thing, we  definitely need a better name for this bear.

4





1 
evolution at it finest





sincerely loving kindhearted beings are eternal 🤗🌏💖





linkin park predicted this anomaly with  hybrid theory





polar bears and grizzley bears are of the same kind. they are still bears!





i was so deterred when the first sentence uttered wa;, "while a hunter killed what he believed to be a white bear"...why government's and people let wild life killers run wild with their guns and with a  paid permit!!!





i’m surprised the scientists are so surprised considering that humans are a hybridized species.

8




the main conclusion of this is that climate change will happen no matter what, and when it gets too extreme is when godzilla emerges





at least it takes place in nature, ligers are man made...sure there are some tigers in india but the animals never cross each other in the wild.





so, the main point is “life finds a way”?





可以生出可育后代那还是两个物种吗？不是会被划分成同一个物种？





this isn’t a new thing it’s been happening all over the planet since it’s inception





it’s different when hybrids mate naturally that of a captive mating.

55




oooooh shit another a1 channel to add to the lineup thank you





this is gonna suck though. if grolar bears can’t mate same as other hybrids then their species is essentially discontinued





lady just cut to the chase , are they harder then polar bears in a scrap!? 🙂👍🏻





never knew narwhals were real🤣





grizzly bear be like :- if ain't snowing i ain't going





i get so saddened when i think of where polar bears will be in ten s. ~ if they will, "be" at all.....

evolution is always evolving. including us humans





this looks really cool





nature finds a way.





the mouse and gorilla thing was a violation guys.

hybrid animals: when the dating pool is drying up.





do not call them “pizzly’s” it sounds like “pissly’s” ;-; either grolars or grozzly’s

85





tbf, the animal kingdom and the world itself has been evolving and changing for millions on billions of s. we just get to see it happen in front of our eyes now. so stuff like new animal breeds or species dying out and such aren't really a new....experience for this world.





all and all, a wolf bear would be fckn awesome





that grizzly bear is wild boy





“not a grizzly or polar bear, but instead a hybrid of the two”
then they are a grizzly and polar bear combined, not a completely different species, still cool video.

1




that grizzly was gangster 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

polar bears are not struggling their population as increased 5 fold from around 5000 in the 70s to over 25000 today

3





1 
it's what the polar bears calls "brown fever" :d





what's better a grizzly or polar. is a pizzly better than both or is it just a product of sex drive. a polar bear in heat will attract a grizzly if its in the vicinity. bing bam boom. pizzly stakes his claim on the puzzly chain.





aren’t polar bear numbers actually going up?

1




that might be the most beautiful bear i’ve ever seen





it’s called ✨evolution✨





with all seriousness, someone must've joked while making the name "pizzly bear".

9




grolar sounds more fitting that pizzly :d





hybrids are there already for s. problem is that hybrids are not protected from hunting. it should be rectified. polar bears evolved  from grizzly to adopt to the north. so basically grizzly  and polar bear are not that different.





omigawwwwwwd but the polar bears were supposed to just stop existing! you mean dr. malcolm was right?! life finds a way?!





so this bear will have the ability to travel and live in cold places but still able to venture south to find better food or to raise their cubs.
a form of migration which is rarely seen in carnivores!





maybe i'm just dumb but i'm pretty sure all the questions posed at 2:00 have the same answer, environmental pressures.





we humans are all basically hyrbids of different humanoids

124





let’s look at dogs though 

hybrids are basically the modern day dog. they all fall under the one banner but many different species. 
they’ve interbred for s





let's be honest, a grisly bear x polar bear is awesome.  calling it a pisly bear is weak.  it's a gd grolar bear.





this blows up the darwin theory





as long as bears stick with the bear gino bears can breed whatever they want daaaah





yes. grolar bear. definately.





life finds always a way.
the hunter: i dont think so.

15




this is nothing new! grizzly & polar bear habitats  have overlapped  since forever. flying the alaska bush for many s i have seen polar & grizzly sharing whale carcasses on many occasions. it is common.





woah there my boy george stephanopoulos doesn't yell the news to you. he delivers it in a nice uncle like tone





lol.... i just learned "the shortest ever recession in us history, which only happened last !" meanwhile, 2 seconds of consecutive gdp growth and the recession is still going strong. that didn't age well.





isn’t that what evolution and adaptation is all about? the hybrid offsprings doing better than their predecessors





half the shit about genetics i learned growing up is wrong now haha





bojack horseman, the true story.

35




are they different species by the law of nature or are they different species by the law of man? maybe the frame of natural academy is questionable after all, before linnaeus  the system had different organization and life went on for millennials without noticing who suppose to mate with whom. i know more anomalies in botanics that does not fit into the today system and now i see zoology also have its anomalies. we might have to give new angle .






1 
donkey dad sounds sooo cute.





nature finds a way.





here is where evolution makes no sense: the video claims that during the ice age brown bears adapted to their environment, somehow their fur turning white, skin black and getting physically larger, yet the concern she gives for polar bears not being cable of achieving the same adaptation change to their new environment is questionable. so someone explain to how an intensely drastic change in environment somehow gave enough time for a brown bear to turn into what we now know as a polar bear, but a polar bear today can't go through the same evolutionary changes?





they have to be called  grizlars!





you know what they say:

“once you go grizzly, you don’t go back”.

111





if a brown bear and 
"polar" bears mate and produce offspring, then by definition they can not be separate species. hence the polar bear is a white phase of brown bear or only a race of bear not a species.





the existence of hybrids doesn't break the definition of separate species really, since it assumes production of fertile offspring. since hybrids don't seem to be fertile - they don't break species delineation.





can we just leave mother nature alone?  my damn!





leave them alone do not kill them 
this needs to be artic is melting 
i really hope thier protected frm trophy hunters..

how do you tag a delk?   shot on in the 80s ask game warden said you can’t tag it take it home m go get your deer.  i tagged it as my deer anyway. point is it’s called evolution.





also, the narrator is blatantly wrong about chromosome incompatibility - does not apply to the arachnids, phylum porifera or phylum annelida, or phylum arthropoda. in fact, interbreeding among totally different amphibians with different chromosome counts has been going on for at least 100 million s.

1




don't you know the song by loverboy? "pig and elephant dna, just wont splice!"





does it really make sense to consider genetically compatible groups as different species, and not just different breeds of the same species?






yeah, they've been "expected to decline" for 20 s and there are more now than then. they are not "headed towards extinction".





hybrid humans are known to be healthier and smarter than their parents too.

5





it's funny how they tall about darwinian evolution with high certitude when it's only a theory that can't be approved





just because one's a polar bear and the other one's a black bear they both belong to the bear family wait. so they could reproduce togetperiodjust because one's a polar bear and the other one's a black bear they both belong to the bear family wait. so they could reproduce together.    the same exact thing is for a llama and a camel. llamas and camels belong to the same animal group. just like donkeys and horses belong to the same animal group.






1 
do hybrid animal make less co2?





expedited evolution for survival. also apart of the supreme divine consciousness.





narwhal beluga hybrid should be called a narluga.





“licensed poacher kills counterfeit bear”

so, once again, science gets it wrong, and instead of mutation, we have hybridization....gotta love the degree to which human beings, in all their supposed brilliance, miss the mark.






1 
it is not like there is a specific drive for individual animals to improve through breeding. they see an animal meeting their requirements to take care of their needs. no population that naturally formed just thought it would be good to mix. if a population outlives another one it is because their environment changed in a way that favored certain traits. 
at the same time, not every species needs to survive. if there is no place for them, they die out. and that's just how it is. if there is no room for them to meet their requirements, why torture them.





if you want me to take this animal seriously, you really got to stop calling it a pizzly





wailord and skitty laugh at your pre zygotic barriers 😎😎😎

1




so according to the definition of species, humans with 0 negative blood types are there own separate species. since they can not reproduce viable offspring without help. and yes this is a question.





so polar bears and grizzlies could become one species and again in a future ice age they could diverge and create separate species once again?
is this why it doesn't seem like every human is the same species?

3




wow that advertisement in the end was seamlessly flawless, good job!





oh. so its literally impossible for evolution or huge mutations to happen at once unless if hybridization is possible of course. it has to be very slow and gradual in order for the chromosomes to pair up and create a fertile offspring?





evolution always finds a way.





this is just a piece of evolution in real time. every species that exists today started out as a hybrid of previous species that died out.

i’m mad my guy had to die just to get discovered by humans

gee golly a grizzly bear that can grow larger and is more inclined to only eat meat..  those encounters are gonna get interesting in a few decades





it makes me cringe every time people say it's impossible, poor souls they are. 
"nature always finds a way"
p.s. that doesn't depend on humans





so you're pretty much telling us that we will soon have human/animal hybrids!?






polar bear and grizzly bear are same species, they are bears





anyone who calls that bear a pizzly is a person of low character that has no respect for anything. nobody should associate with such a person.

13





can't wait for the orcas to evolve with feet. lol, that would be fucked up.





a bear is still a bear, just like a fish is still a fish. shouldn't be surprised to see any hybrids.





frankly our definition of species is far too narrow.





that's all bull about the sea ice being a problem polar bears & grizzlies have been in contact for a long time they both have hunted in the permafrost of the north. the ice caps change constantly & as of recent measures have actually been on the increase not shrinkage!





everything must pass and nothing is really that important in the universe.

1




little known fact, apparently polar bears are in fact polar grizzly bears.

6





1 
also unless you're of pure native african  ancestry you're a hybrid of a neanderthal and homo sapien! also there's this place in mexico where human females are trying to mate with horses and dogs and their is this dolphin in florida that is mating with humans!





montana has a problem with hybrid wolf's because leftist thought we needed them cause they are just soooooo dang cute and cuddly

2




just started watching this video.  how long before they blame global warming?  update : 7 minutes.





you speak as though the ice breaking up is an issue for polar bears yet there are more now then before by a fair amount and now they are crossing with grizzlies so they will be just fine





i just hope they’re not as quiet as hybrid cars.





"real science" 

"this is bad news for polar bears" 

their population has been doing just fine, if not thriving. 
22500 individuals were estimated to exist in 2005 
more than 30000 are estimated to exist now.

ah great the two deadliest bears alive are naturally breeding together and essentially making polar bears with bigger claws and that can withstand higher temperatures to survive in both canada and the usa.

that ice cap melting is really biting us right in the ass in ways we never thought huh?





purebreds are always the most beautiful..





is anyone going to talk about how it really happens?  who makes the first move, etc, etc, etc etc, etc, etc…





major problem for students and teachers of evolution. can only breed within a ‘species’ or ‘kind’. this allows birds fish animals to adapt to climate needs only. but not into another kind or species. all my 74yrs i listen as they call the difference between “an apple” and “an orange” a missing link. of course it’s “missing” it ain’t there.





the polar mama be like...
once you go brown you never back down...





for the love of all things wild, please let’s not call them pizzly bears… grolar is so much better

5





1 
every species has its time, all species will eventually go extinct if they can't adapt. the decline of the polar bear was inevitable





hybrids are not " useless " in nature . the evolution of bears should be endless . as long as the face of the earth is ever changing . nothing is beyond nature . it's all about survival in this big , bad , world 😘





all hail pizzly snow " the king in the north!!!"





what makes you think that hybrids aren't just an adaptation to changing environmental conditions and that polar bears will actually go extinct. have you looked at the lastest popluation counts?





you call em hybrids i call it evolution before our eyes





“first ever discovered in the wild”….and someone killed it

41





well love is love 😁 even humans have inter-racial marriages and children 😁





just a thought. even if humans didn't cause the global warming problem it would still happen anyway in a few thousand s. during the time of the dinosaurs the global temperature was in the mid-30’s celsius. what is the global temperature now? 20th century average of 13.7°c.





the king in the noooorth!!!!





so was the trophy hunter arrested???

also, they shouldn't call them pizzly/grolar bears. call them northern hybrids. appropriately boring. won't cause the poor bastards to friend zone each other from embarrassment





the most common sense video i have ever seen ☠️





2 male grizzly bears: c'mon lets have a little fun
female polar bear: noo what am i gonna tell my parents!
grizzly bears: nothing will happen we're too different don't worry. 
about 200 days later mom they lied to me about biology
meanwhile whales: 
let's have fun under the ice it'll confuse the humans lol

53





humans are the most hybrid species across the planet. you don't think that other mammals will do the same. this is also one-hundred-percent our fault because of the weather .we are putting stress among the species to either adapt or die





this list proves the bible is real when it says animals produces after it's kind. if different types of dogs can produce after it's kind, why you all shocked when other animal species produces after it's kind?
noah only took one pair of animal from each kind.

natures way of survival





okay, i'm all for polar bear -grizzly hybrids, but if someone seriously suggests calling them pizzlies, i will blow my top.
that name is just downright... ugly. from a phonetic point of view.





as climate change warms the earth the polar bears might have to be moved south to the south pole, if they are to survive at all...
in a perfect world, we would stop this human predatory behavior but until we find a way to deal with the human condition,  we will forever go round and round...
we are self serving first, we will do whatever it takes to provide for our own needs both real and imagined and only once they have been met do we worry about anyone else or the bigger picture. 
this is the human condition.  
this is what stops us from correcting our past- present and future mistakes. 
if we could terraform mars or any other planet than why not start here on earth first? 
it's not a reality, that's why.
 just another slight of hand trick, to distract us from the fact the planet is dying and corporate greed and western consumerism is leading us all down that path to hell....
has anyone considered many of these northern animals travel across the ice back znd forth between canada, greenland znd russia? russia has had so many nuclear disasters ( we only heard about the ones they couldn't cover up, as they were seen from space - there were as many as 35!!! beginning just after ww2) these nuclear plants are on the water, and just like japan have been flushing waste water into the artic ocean for decades...this is going to effect every animal in the north...birth defects were noticeable on dead baby whales, narwhal, seals znd a few 3 eyed fish back in the late 1980's when i worked for the explorer inn ( yellow knife nwt - we did hunts from alert out on the ice for spoiled wealthy american trophy hunters, hunting north america's big 5 ) 
all i am saying is there are other reasons for some of these changes seen in northern species than inter breeding





spoiler alert: most animals of today was hybrids in the past.

3





1 
please don’t call them pizzly or grolar. just do prisly or prislyr bear





it's called evolution,  animals don't go extinct they change to survive.





so what you mean is. when the earth is in a state of rappid change the barriers fade away. to make sure that animals can quickly adaped to the changes.





the tone of this discussion is one of disparity for species that may be disappearing. man (read science) has always presumed to know better than mother nature (read god) when it come to what & how certain species are labeled (read invasive) and what the earths climate should be (read man hasn’t got a clue). the planet does what it has always done & man does what it has always done (read thinks it is god)






1 
my neighbor is a hybrid 😂





why are trophy hunters allowed to kill polar bears as they are already having issues to survive?

5





pizzly goes so hard fr





science calls them species, the bible calls them kinds. a bear is a bear after all.





i just knew that penguin at the zoo was giving me the bedroom eyes. everyone laughed at me for poppin’ a chubby but if they knew the nasty things she was telling me with that look..





doesn't this video also only prove the importance of pure-blooded animal species and why we can't let them go extinct?





mate with their ancestors? time travel, confirmed! also, i'm my own grandpa.





be more like bears, guys. instead of hating on each other for the color of their fur, they um... 
b r e e d

6





polar bears aren't going extinct. even if they were, a better adapted species taking their niche is just nature. nothing sad about it tbh.





why is losing the polar bear "undoubtedly a terrible tragedy"? something like 99.9% of species are extinct was each of those loses a terrible tragedy too? we've all grown up with the understanding that those incapable of adapting to their changing environment lose the game of evolution. that fact in of itself is the driving force of evolution, it's the reason we're here now to witness that fact. 

if anything we should be loudly celebrating the genetic viability of the grolar bears because both species of bears get to keep evolving, it's like they got a 1up in the game of evolution.





i once saw a pamel a hybrid between a pakistani and camel. i have also heard of shelsh  sheep and welsh. so what is the fuss about?





the barrier is set by god and he knows his creatures so he opens doors for them. i like science but i also believe in a higher power.





the tv show zoo is starting to make sense nature will find a way because humans don't no when to stop.





lmao @ the gorilla and hamster 😭😭😭

9





there is misinformation in it: polar bear population is increasing! even though the professor who actually count it lost her job (due to university didn’t want to lose their “climate crisis research funds“ and fired her. highly appreciated if you would fact check it before misinforming others.





groler sounds a lot better than pizzly.





once you go grizzly, you never go back





god is definitely real! changing science right before our eyes!





first our women, now bears 😂🤣. don’t get bent out of shape, i’m white and my wife of 19 s is black latina mix. people take jokes too damn seriously now days lol





sigh why can’t the answer ever just be ‘love…love finds a way’

4





change is a constant. that's a scientific fact. there's nothing wrong, depressing, terrible or catastrophic about it. it's necessary. get a grip and embrace it, not morally justify it!






1 
very cool. don’t hunt them, we need them for our eco system





i'm confused, i was taught in high school that two animals of different species cannot produce fertile offspring. what?!?





grolar bear sounds way better than pizzly bear just sayin

1




i think its because animal species are dying out due to hunting and people encroaching on their territories, so they have no choice but to breed hybrids for the survival of their species.

1




i really really really dont want polar bears to go extinct!
i wonder if artifical ice shelves can help the issue although it will be temporary fix 
reducing climate change is pretty much the best solution...

8





just remember folks that the wild ass and the horse can breed and have viable offspring also understand that the genetic difference between a wild ass and a horse is much greater than an orangutan is from a human!!!   😍😳🤯😏

2




human races are subspecies similar to polar/brown bears. true diversity would be to keep the races separate.





well think of what type of bear the polar bear evolved from





using brown bear and grizzly bear interchangeably kind of hurts your credibility.





the world has been warming since the ice age with mini ice ages in between.and has had no ice caps before.

1




today i learned that lady polar bears have a thing for male grizzlies. either that or male grizzlies are crazy brave and chase away male polar bears.

3




i don't believe these animals are "breeding" on their own. the animals respect the "order" of yah(god). they have always respected the order that yah has put in place, for "all" mankind & animals. since the days of "adam". why all of a sudden, they are upsetting the "order" of yah??? don't believe this occurs, without mankind interference. shalom ✊🏿 🤴🏿





life finds a way





don't be surprised if they blame this "new discovery" on global warming.





“it started when my mom met my dad and they had me, hi my name is pizzly and my life, is pretty wild”

3




isnt this a type of evolution due to climate conditions in those areas?





people are just secretly breeding them and putting them out in nature to track how they behave 🙄





i'm a maog! half man, half dog! i'm my own best friend.

6





1 
“officials seized”.  that means they stole it...





great great video 🐻 💘 🎥👌👍





the one hybrid we all should be worried about is manbearpig 😂😂

4




with the environmental changes going it's adapt or die.





i would think who put this information together would have known that the liger was man made an not an natural event of a hybrid





so is there a list of animals and their number of chromosomes and whether or not they match, yet? cause id love to know which animals are most likely to hybridize completely; so we could, like, help them do it.

3




let's just pray that a bat doesn't ever fall in love with a tiger!

3





oh no, why did they call them pizzlies instead of grolar bears ???





life finds a way. 

especially when their entire planet is on fire and is being destroyed and are being hunted by humans

14





hypothetically can humans mate with say monkeys ?





life, uh, finds a way.





says liger shows a tigon.

15





1 
yes yes lets go spidermonkey as in actual spiders and monkeys





well, thats actually a loss in biodiversity.





so what? if this happened in the wild without human intervention then it’s probably happened many millions of times in the past. it’s perfectly natural and we humans should just let nature take its course. not everything is a problem we have to “fix”.

7





1 
i didn't know species with different number of chromosome can mate and reproduce, i thought different number of chromosome means no offsprings!

1




we are seeing evolution before our eyes people!





they already have.
take a stroll(armed) around any northern english city and the evidence is undeniable.

4




let’s not name anything pizzly, pretty please. grolar it is.





polar bear was after that bbc even the bears are infected with wokisum

1




nanulak is a good name for pizzly / grolar :)

3




key take away, .. in 100 thousand s im going to be depressed.





maybe grizzlies and polar bears are just different ethnicities like japanese and mezo americans

6




polar bear dare over population of polar bear should be token off endanger list





gather round and behold 






manbearpig 😃

1




i used to believe there were no absolutes (never, always, etc.), however, there is one absolute that cannot be ignored - change. nothing ever stays the same; change comes, like it or not.

15




humans may be the remains of something like this. we know we mated with both neanderthal and denisovans. our chromosomes must have matched.

1




her:”what’s is making this animal hybridize”
them: bitch y’all keep killing our own kind





see’s an unknown type of bear - shoots it. 🤦🏻‍♂️

11





hybrid,  a more appropriate term, than a mut.





what if the donkey is born with another chromosome





imagine trying to kill a polar bear anyway

5




"after she took that grisly d. she never looked at a white bear again" 🤣





oh man, we have so much to answer for.





why are trophy hunters shooting endangered animals like polar bears ?

12





loool i've always believed 2 bears of any kind can reproduce ...





i really wish hybrid animals were named a little more creatively instead of just combining their parents' names. "pizzly"? really? even "grolar" is lame, but pizzly sounds like an insult.

3




"experts", well, they are not really that expert, because one day they say that something is impossible, and the next day they tell you that it was possible.





there are more polar bears now than ever.

1




this new bears should be called "freezlys"

3





1 
why didn't they named it bolar pear? 💀





why are we allowing trophy hunting of polar bears. aren't they a threatened species?

3




“pussy is pussy” - the grizzly bears 😂

1




but like isn't hybridization the exact same as a correct breed dog/cat


i mean like...





4:25 donkey dad...

3





1 
in the natural, maybe each of their species are low in numbers.





hybridization also can push evolution faster.





"hey look, a polar bear".  "protected species".  "hmm, looks like it mated with a brown bear".  "waste it!"

3




they should call the grizzlar bears.





i mean when you think of it, human race is equal to different species of animals.. i mean we see different races of people interbreed and make kids, animals of different species should be able to do the same as long as they are of the same circle. human + human = human so polar + grizzly = pizzly/grolar. similar could happen with other animals as long as they are in the circle of relation.






it's almost like the ice caps naturally come and go over centuries, and animals adapt on their own and we don't need to try to intervene all of the time. maybe we should accept that the environment changes constantly and learn how to adapt instead of doubling down and insisting that we are causing these natural changes and we have to stop them from happening.

8





chihuahua + elephant = elehua or chihuaphant.





cat gurl here we come

3





hybrid cars, hybrid food, hybrid animals and hybrid humans nowadays





the name pizzly sounds pizzingly bad

4




the days of noah are upon us!





humans of all species shocked by hybrids 🤔





your only working on a limited life history, life is longer than your living history, your working on bones, life adapts, pure bred offspring is not the only option! like takes over then your theories come into question

3




the king in the north!










every time she says "pizzlies" i cringed.
way too close to "pixies" to name the offspring of two awesome bears.

3





1 
human gorilla hybrid when? i hope never, but you never know.





so the natural world is basically one huge smorgasbord of sex?





i have a few kid's. if they are as strong, smart and adaptable as me or better,😎. we'll be ok.

1




oh wow... don't let tucker carlson find out all the white polar bears are going to be replaced by pizzly bears

2




you're telling me there's no polar bears in antarctica if they are that's a contradiction to this video





& what makes you think this has not been going forever?





nothing about cyo-wolves?





watched out of curiosity about hybrids, left feeling bad for polar bears :(





life..uh..finds a way





"real science" "susan crockford fired after finding polar bears thriving despite climate change"





2 different grizzlies?  she had a taste for some dark meat... lol

i'll show my self out





hybrids are op. xd





same can be said of humans





but but do these hybrids hibernate?





saying brown bear cannot mate with polar bear is saying that a indian man/women cannot mate with danish women/men





this happened with neanderthals and us, also.





yeah, the "recovered" bear video didn't have white hair like a polar bear.





animals are having mixed babies too!? oh lord 😂❤





black bear to polar bear: hello gorgeous, wanna make a panda?





fascinating





femelle polar bear be like: ones you go black you never come back





if we keep on changing the climate, we may have no animals like lion leopard grizzlies and polar bears no wolves and even coyotes just leapon grolar coywolf etc





research boats breaking ice, might not be a great idea





grizzily probably got catfished on bear tinder, common mistake.





no way horses and donkeys are 4 million s old





polar bears refuse to go extinct👏





you can actually legally hunt a polar bear ?? i thought they was dying off and in trouble ?





new evolutions happening. human: lets kill it.





real science that’s for sure lol





i guess it's only like humans different races that all it is really, there both bears just from different parts of the world, same with big cat, small cats, dogs, where all animals at the end of the day 😂






1 
the animals are worried about rising fuel prices.





is this how the bojack universe works





everyone says they belive in evolution but don't understand how it happens





someone send this to joe rogan!





hunting bears in 2006. isnt bear a protected species?





humans have been doing this for s.





it's almost like...evolution lol





2:00 "life.. uhm... finds a way".





this is all amusing until some dude mates with a random animal and then producing the first of many beastmen.





can we all agree that we don't go trophy hunting? what the hell.





if animals can't breed outside their kind now why do we assume millions of s can do something we can't observe today?






1 
narwhals actually have one tooth their tusk





with enough vodka, anything is possible.





so if human and chimps came from a same species.. can they interbreed?





alright when are we getting the super cute turtle ducks feelin avatar then





polar bears are flourishing





13:53. nothing is free chic. if it's completely free, then we're the product!





10:17
sansa doesn't agree with this





that is the end of the line 
once produced that's it





biology is awsome....not as religions but awsome...(ironic mode on)!!!





they shouldn’t have dropped the ‘r’ in pizzly. prizzly sounds more correct.





maybe some time human can mate with monkeys and some will say it is a free will and people are free to do what ever they want then the (( free)) world will protect the new mutants






1 
its important to kill anything that moves





the gorilla + hamster 💀






1 
it’s evolution baby!





majority of videos i saw on this channel, i learnt that we humans are idiots!





all animals are highbred its just a matter of time. u may see it as one breed but it evolved to that breed over many s .what we call highbreds are animals that have combined recently. but thats what they all do since the beginning of time!





octopi not octopus’s 😂😂😂





why would you want to hunt polar bear? aren’t they endangered? i thought they were





the polar bear and grizzly bear are the same species










10:17 the king in the north





female polar bears are going wild 😂





once you go grizzly, you never go back?





they dont see no race, just love. haha.





🗣man made‼





life... er..  finds a way....





love is blind 😁😂





life uhhhh, finds a way





dont call a seriously and potentially vicious animal a...... pizzly.  gtfo
golar bear, works fine





👍 🧬

1




they are probably going back to what they were.





when you go kodiak you don't go back.





okay that's it!! time to mate with a tigress.





human/snail hybrid, when?





seem like natural part of evolution





polar bears and grizzly bears are not different species.





millions of s
hahahahahahaha 
that's hilarious





animals are trying to adopt for new conditions of world





why is there hybreeds .. it's because it's evolution of life and in the end to evolve ya must get a hybreed





a tiger and lion are both cats same species





imagine caog and doat





killing a polar bear should be a crime at this point





their the same species not same genetics but species can reproduce





umm.... life... finds a way..... "malcolm"





once you go brown? that’s the joke i use





anyone getting vampire diaries vibes?





i would assume animal hybrids are a form of diversification and evolution, no?





pizzlies case is not sad at all!





just waiting for humans to have its own extinction hahaha





that's evolution there





hold up there's light skin bears now?





i'm really interested but i just got off from a long day working in the hot sun... you lost me after prizzly-bear





here's a joke you can answer. what do get if you bred a donkey with a horse?





i mean...we humans are hybrids





i know one thing, hybrids do not look right and kinda look grotesque. probably something we should stay away from

1




dude scientist mixed these breeds & then reported to the public as if the animals mixed with each other;  wow they lie so well 😂😂😂😂





so in the matter of gammies.....ah ah life finds away





you say "the north", but how does this compare to the sub-antarctic regions?





wow!!










isn’t it octopi ? 😅





this same thing has happened in the past with sapiens: hybrid homo and neanderthals. many of you reflect this result. it’s from the “north”.





its been proven recenty that the mutations r not ramdom





are we not hybrids?





03:34 ?  what would that be called?





the mule calls you bet and raises.





we're hybrids, what's the difference?

1




yes but aren't most hybrids infertile and can't themselves produce offspring?






1 
"pushing animals to hybridize" seems like an unfounded assumption





geneticists suspect this is what happened to the neanderthals. very interesting.





because its nature. go with the flow. just like yt woman & black men should be together





nah ,, they just evolving to match the current environment





once you go grizzly...





hell, we have hybrid humans, who not hybrid animals????





grizzly bear = brown bear. so why grolar bear when there is brolar bear?






1 
if they can mate, they're the same species.  and the term species isn't even clearly defined.





polar bear had jungle fever





a bear has sex with a bear...what do you get?  a bear...a new spices a bear...





generalist traits-omnivore.





not all are sterile. coywolves have reproduced for s.





grizzly or polar i don’t want to see no bear on my walk

1




how about grillar bear





3:36 man bro gorilla is down bad im deaad

1




aren't a few of us a hybrid of the neanderthals and other human species?





unfortunately the grizzly and polar bear are the same species only the hair colour is different. scientists have known this for decades!





we ourselves are hybrids.






1 
life will find away.





in theory humans should be able mate with monkeys





as long as they’re drinking coca colas





so when a horse decide to fuck a narwhal, we'll get a unicorn?

1




all different kinds of people today are having kids different nationalities different colors why not the animals ? 😂





aren't all animals hybrids why there's so many different subspecies





at last, a much wanted diversity!





the idea of species developed in a time where so called racial sciences and eugenics were popular. the reality is that species are not as delineated as we think.










why did the guy shoot a polar bear though… what’s wrong with ppl..





must not be  too different





it's pretty obvious it's bout survival animals are adapting to nature





wooow thats sick





evolution is happening constantly

1




a pizzly grolar!





maybe these animals just see themselves as non binary? 🤣





if you speed up the video, her voice isn't quite as annoying.





so... did anyone else see that monkey frog video?





just wait till they start with humans





my question was why did he shoot?  that's whatbthe discussion should be. naturally hybrid is nature evolution.  that's how things happened for millennium





it's a change of evolution





yall watched we bare bears? just asking 🙆
yk? three friends ; panda , grizzly and polar 💁
😨 i-i........?





so climate change nations who benefitted a lot should also heed this other than catastrophic they don't like to heed‼️





it will only remain a very tiny percentage. naturally will never become absolute as it is against natural law.





so they found lightskin grizzlys? 😂😂





hybrids are usually healthier





in times of crisis i would hope these bears would put there racism aside.





why is he shooting polar bears?





another win for humans 😑





that is nice of them to take them outta there habitat






1 
maybe american lions were just ligers and tigons🤷🏽‍♂️





gorilla and hamster, of course it not fit :v





some grizzlies have white fur fetish





this might be good for genetic diversity.





y’all think tiger used to have stripes no there was a big orange hat that mixed with a big black cat duh





my cousin is a hybrid





so why is somebody hunting polar bears if they are endangered ?






we humans also creates hybrides





why was the pos trying to shoot a polar bear to begin with?





0:20 🤣





i hope the trophy hunter was arrested





noahs arc returning





a pizzley? that name is not going to stick





life uh uh finds a way





once you go polar you never go back





oh this is real science ay? lol





once they go black bear they'll never go back





them boys just drunk off that ocean juice and fuggin whatever





ok so when are we getting cat girls





uuuhhhh~
the polar bear lady knows what she prefers hahahahaha~ :d





what……….  these people are doing this.





avatar the last air bender but irl?





love is love





i’m high as hell locked in on this vid





interracial bear lovin' in the wild? who knew





bruh you think this is like frowned upon in the animal kingdom. like mama bear is sad when her baby girl gets knocked up by a polar bear?





wow pizzlies lol cant you come up with a better name than that !!!!

1




hippo and rhino





at the beginning of the video the main subject  gets shot and killed wtf?





adapt to survive





kodiak bear?





why did he shot the bear??? was he go in ng to eat it for food & use its skin for warmth? these poor majestic animals have a hard enough time.☹👎





i got a half  bulldog half  shih tzu wee call it a bullshit!





from ape to humans?





3:36 i’m the gorilla





all eastern coyotes are coyote, wolf, and dogs.





polar grizzly





pizzly? really? how about grizlor.....much better, right?





oooo a rare new animal lets capture it and lock it up real quick





what, polar bear hunting is allowed?!





lmfao you know the male polar bears mad like wow you just like brown bears hahahaha





guess white bear chicks are thirty for brown bear guys too





that's why we have centaurs - a man having sex with a horse.





i have rats x hamster hatchling





narluga whales 🐋





i'll tell you what's causing the animals to hybridize. human kind killing all of them like it's going outta style. their hybridizing is how they'll even get close to carrying on their legacy





the  grizzly a light skin lol

1




furries after watching this vid: 👀





one step closer to atla





ok i see the sources in the video comment... but anyway saounds sketchy and the title feels click-baity, like, this video gets to generalistic conclusions based on 1-speciment samples. i'll read the sources because the topic does interest me.





humans are the most hybrid animal.





humans and chimpanzees hybrids will become common





can confirm.
am biracial and have no children.

(joke)





ofcourse, some ass had to kill it.





its called extinction





gorilla plus mouse equals nope  😆





animals evolving?





prizzlygrolar.





why not? that is evolution.

which one is the colonizer (that we agree its acceptable to hate) and which one is the oppressed minority (that we defend regardless of merit)?

i just want to be the good guy, please tell me who to focus on during my two minutes of hate.





no judgement ironic huh??🤔





so this momma polar bear likes her men dark.





ya cant leave nature alone  sad human





millions of s and global warming 🤣





jungle fever?





why are we still hunting other animals?





why shoot them?





man-bear-pig?





couldn't handle her saying pizzly one more time so i'm outta here.





different species of human mixed





yall need to leave them animals tf alone messing up stuff. when ur think they helping





maby the neanderthals were the specialists in our scenario





does it make him lightskin bear?

bbc 💪🏾





no evolutionary benefit to hybridisation? you're saying that out loud as a member of the most advanced species on the planet...which just so happens to be a hybridised species of various earlier hominids






1 
not appreciating the way the start of the commercial was disguised as connected with the substantive part of the video...





don’t kill animals!





pizzly sounds cute





hybridization is evolution





humans and neanderthals..  just figure out how they did it.





melting pot lol





ebony and ivory...





scientist want to hybrid the gorilla with squirrel
..hahaahahha





skooalll …. skull  … same thing





and who’s fault is that hmm





4:11 proves you will lie to get your story out. what a shame.





gorilla + mouse = no





i just 🤎 big brutal brown bulky #bears🐻.

1




all animals are about to die because the homo sapiens maybe it just nature trying to impose a new world order xd





love





hmmm . . . that tradigrade looks quite sexy.  i wonder . . .





mate "man" with cat, and you improve "man" and do nothing for the cat.





polar bear went black...





less than two minutes in, the fact that scientists don’t agree on what a species is plagues the video. the idea that species cannot cross, as the video presents, is only true if a species is defined like how we were taught in school - a group of organisms which can breed reproductively fit organisms. however, when scientists refer to polar bears and grizzlies as separate species, that is not what they mean. they simply mean that these two bears are genetically and geographically distinct populations through natural selection. that definition doesn’t prohibit hybridization at all.

you can see this really well when it comes to brambles (rubus). these plants are divided into many species using definition 2. however, most of these species can cross with each other and bear fertile offspring. so if we go by definition 1, most brambles are the same species.

it’s not nearly as surprising that polar bears and brown bears can cross when you understand that.





grizzlor.





why that bustard poacher killed innocent  bear?why not he punished!!?he could sedate the bear





people  will  destroy are  planet.the ground  the water land.all over money





grizzlar / polzzy bears





i hope the polar bear share chromosome with koala, no more meat, just leaves and how cute is that have a vegan polar bear sized koala....





that’s called evolution 🤷‍♂️





i don't know how you make a video on animal hybrids of the north without even once mentioning coyote - wolf population mixing...





animals can be sick little perverts.





polar bear is targaryen





it looks cool





and...car hybrid





so polar bears like bbc?





hybrid isn't new i think even we wouldn't exist with hybrid among our hominins





humans are hybrids, according to evolution.





how progressive





nobody's gonna question the shooting ??

1




it’s called evolution.





i bought grizzly bear covers , do you sleep in covers at night time ?????????????





satan and the fallen angels have been doing this since the beginning of time. they're just where the public can't see them yet!! but just eait. jesus is at the door and every eye will see.  the bible says the sky will roll back like a scroll and then those who did not know lord shall tremble.





black father and white mother. even animals don't discriminate. i'm joking btw.

1




the dude ahd to pay like some 40k as a fine like the f?





lol you cant mate because of my definition of species





interesting, so basically polar bears came out of brown bears when they had to due to climate change, and now the same is happening, just the other way around. natural processes.

also, 'pizzleys'? come on 😂






1 
it’s all due to climate change and is a sign of worry not to celebrate of the new species





8:05 bru my man grizzly just got lost and hooked up with a white chick nothing wrong in that i think my man grizzly heard rumours of buetifull white women roaming the icy land from uncle ben probably we human didn't do anything





we have chimpanzees . . . right? we have humans . . . right? yet we came from "chimpanzees" but we have no "in-betweens" sooo . . . explain . . . v.v'





so we gone act like polar bears aren’t different descendants of grizzlies that fur adapted to be clear to reflect the snow. lets just white wash everything & make shit up as we go 🤦🏾‍♂️ 🤦‍♀️ 🤦 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏾‍♂️





god made all creatures to reproduce within it's kind . so dog with dog, bear with bear and so on. nature will always find a way





so you mean why evolution might do the thing its been doing forever. great





were all hybrid animals everything alive is a hybrid





this was a fun and entertaining video but why can’t we accept that god is real or is it that we are scared that he is real and that one day he is returning and will punish the wicked and the ones that denied him and sent them straight to hell? think about that have an amazing day and god bless every single one of yous.






1 
it's because the animals all had to go to diversity training to keep their jobs





what is she talking about!? does she realise that humans those of us in europe are to hibrids





sad





trophy hunting any species that is endangered is messed up. plain and simple.





it called life we do it we mate with other race it the law of nature





it's kind of weird to use the euphimism "made it with" in an educational science video. why not use terminology? bred with, cross bred, mated, procreated... so many better ways of saying it





yeah so let's shoot it sounds about right for humans.





scientists didn't know that animals can mate and survive but you'll believe them with your soul we they say there is no god...






1 
i despise trophy hunting





maybe the mistake being on classification of two species, polar and grizzly bears, when actually are only two races from the same species like a mallinoar and german shepherds.






1 
hybrids sounds so logical. theory of random mutations never sat well with me. random is chaos not order.
we clearly know nothing about the our planet.
 the old theories based on our limited knowledge are fables of old grandma at best. 
humans are also changing. i think we are at peak of our civilization and are now collapsing. i think there will be a lot fewer humans less advanced.





maybe, so crrrrrrrrazy christians were onto something with "kinds".





why not just simplify everything and just call it evolution? haha cmon guys, keep up





that's old news





humans is also hybrids...






1 
"pizzly" bruh.





human are hybrids too! so why animals can't? we have black, white, hispanic, asian hybrid ☝️






1 
haha a bear is bear  lion is cat so tigger and horse donkey or zebra are all horses that why humans are are not primate the only horseand camila that the only one haven't seen





sometimes it works like the coywolf but other times you end up with a useless panda type thing that is so ridiculous it needs help so it doesn't commit self genocide through sheer stupidity





grolar 🐻





man, some of these commenters are so ignorant about the environment and animal conservation.  there is nothing wrong with modern day trophy hunting.  in many places it is the lifeblood of conservation.  and in most cases, it helps to control overpopulation.

they are conflating trophy hunting with poaching, which are two distinct and separate things.  further, they seem ignorant of how the environment and ecosystems work.  as if the only “correct” environment is that which existed when they are alive.  that’s a giant experiential bias.  there is no “correct” ecosystem.  the only correct environments are those in which our human species can survive and thrive.  along the way some species will go extinct, others won’t.  not all species, or all breeds of species must survive.   that’s all in your naive little minds. some really arent necessary or are easily replaced, others are necessary and impossible to replace.  conflating them all as if every species is as important as the next is just the highest level of ignorance.  and no, we can’t save them all, nor do we need to.

1




stop thinking in species and think in kinds.






1 
pozzly bear





why do people think it's ok to kill for sport? animals aren't our toys and we shouldn't be hunting them for anything but food if we absolutely have to. these types of things piss me off. the only reason you should ever kill an animal is to either defend yourself or your loved ones or for survival. if you're in the wild and have to defend your life i understand, but we can't keep doing things like this. murder is murder idc what species you are.





steph curry bears?





nah i aint calling it a pizzly

1





1 
%75 u sad is wrong





why the fuck was a trophy hunter killing polar bears???





did the impossible





hybrids can be a succes, like obama





missed play on words opportunity. instead of saying "not your typical bear", it would have been very funny if you said "not your average bear".





polargrizz





omg stop saying "pizzlies". 😀





humans are hybrids too, since we all have small part of neanderthals dna





what is pushing animals to mate ? hmm
humans mate with everything, even corpse, do what's wrong with that





can we get a better name for pizlies? that name just sounds like piss





31 chromosomes from his azz dad lol





all we will be left with are mullato bears lpl





your forgetting your bible... they may be different "species" but they are part of the same kind... so they are totally able to mate... this isnt new





grolar. sounds better





that would be weird if all evolution is , is interbreeding species.....🤔😮





animals are becoming as perverted as humans-we phuq anythang!





global warming. species adaptations.





a lot of the "facts" in this video are wrong.





how bout "polar-grizz" instead of a dumb name like pizzly?





hybridization isn't new not in animals or people. i say let nature take it's course.





well...
we humans are hybrids too.
neanderthalers mated with a new version of humans.
africans mate with whites and produce hybrids.
asians mate with hispanics, and so on and produce hybrids.
aboriginals and so on...
why on earth is that necesary?
well...ask them why they had sex together?
we humans allways want good reasons to explain something. is it useful? is it this or that? 
you know...sometimes you need to let go why and why not things happen and just let life be.






1 
i think trophy hunters should be hunted! i’d take pleasure in doing that.

little mermaid is a human and a fish.





really? pizzly?





omg climate change panic! 
meanwhile, nature

you're saying denisovans wrong man it's denisovans, not denisovans man get it together. did i even spell that right?






1 
he's isn't polar nor grizzly, but a hybrid ??! so why when you mix black and white you can't just be biracial 🤦🏻‍♂️ americans





what if or what if .. this is purposely being done in labs and being released into the wild ?





eye stopped on the “random mutations”, such a quaint and archaic concept. snicker





also what in the fuck do you think half of the dogs in the world are?! they are literally hybrids





now if we could just hybridize a democrat and republican, all our problems will go away.






you found 1 hybrid so i guess that's how evolution works, lol.  you basically stated that it's impossible for it to breed so i guess that's been immediately debunked but then you theorize about how that could have been how species evolved.  you proved that theory wrong then thought it could have been how things happened, so which is it?





so evolution happens, you're just noticing now.  did you pay attention in school?





neandertaal not thal is how you pronounce that. come on..





like this for team pizzley





indochinians bred with denisovans and caucasians bred with neanderthals it's not a full mix





isn't this what happened to neanderthals? they hibridized themselves in humans until they went extinct.

white boy hunting a already endangered species 😮‍💨where have i heard this before





pizzly and grolar are both horrible names.





new nba team coming soon





bull shit , the polar bear ppulation has never been higher and is still growing





man , gorilla......nfl





why yall being racist, stop saying a polar bear can hook up with a grizzly





mixed race rizz





so there is no evolution just interspecies mating






this was a good video, until they started the climate change innuedo.





are the polar bears a metaphor for white people? 😂 😂😂😂





oh great a trophy hunter finds a magnificent animal & murders it. i vote that we collect all the trophy hunter's together dump them on a deserted island & let them hunt each other.





arent most all if not all animals alive today some form of a past hybrid? nature will decide not us. so stop worrying about it.





hate to break this to you, but mules can reproduce. the chances are stupid slim. it has happened tho.





i agree tv is very off putting it seems like they want your anxiety to be at a level of perpetual anger or fear





bears in general are struggling to survive because greedy humans are stealing their food source and not because the environment is changing. thankyou for your limited attention span. lol.





why? i know climate change .





states the defenition of species
repeatedly makes claims that are counter to the defenition despite continuing to use the term
such science much wow






it's not impossible, really?
it's just like a black man and white women. geeze





12:34 😂 comical! all of this mixing filth is just like in the days of noah! 

jasher 4:18-19 kjva

18 and their judges and rulers went to the daughters of men and took their wives by force from their husbands according to their choice, and the sons of men in those days took from the cattle of the earth, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and taught the mixture of animals of one species with the other, in order therewith to 👉🏾 provoke the lord👈🏾; and god saw the whole earth and it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon earth, all men and all animals.

19 and the lord said, i will blot out man that i created from the face of the earth, yea from man to the birds of the air, together with cattle and beasts that are in the field for i repent that i made them.

genesis 6:1-7 kjv — and it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. and the lord said, my spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty s. there were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. and the lord said, i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that i have made them.

matthew 24:36-44 kjv — but of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my father only. but as the days of noe were, so shall also the coming of the son of man be. for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the son of man be. then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your lord doth come. but know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh.

joel 3:13 kjv — put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.

joel 3:16 kjv — the lord also shall roar out of zion, and utter his voice from jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of israel.

joel 3:20-21 kjv — but judah shall dwell for ever, and jerusalem from generation to generation. for i will cleanse their blood that i have not cleansed: for the lord dwelleth in zion.

stop mixing!!!!

pizzley, is the most annoying sounding name for an animal. polar-grizzly or grizzly-polar would sound better.





furries assemble 🤣





interracial dating that's all





why did the primitives shoot the bear??? 👎🏾👎🏿👎🏾👎🏿🤬😡🇳🇬🇺🇸

what are you talking about?? this aint a new era! cross species breeding has been like there since forever!





who made this a high school student 👎





im just gunna ask the question we're all thinking: if i did a monkey would it work?





isnt this evolution in working? like us as humans interracially reproduce?





bear = bear? or animal? 
polar = race?
grizly = race?
polar + grizly = hybrid?

human = human? 
pakistani = race?
norwegian = race?
pakistani + norwegian = hybrid?

or did i do the math wrong, maybe this is right?

polar = white?

grizly = black?

grizly + polar = hybrid? multicultural? mixed race?

im not gonna do the other one again, do you understand my question?
what is different between human races and animal races? we humans clearly have different looks and figures too, just as animals, and why can animals be hybrid, but we humans are too butthurt to be called something easy as that, instead we need to heal the wound with a beautiful and complicated word and explaination..





12:09 look it’s elon musk's predecessor.





pizzly sounds awful. hopefully someone comes up with a better name





humans do it what's the big fucking deal





why do videos like this always try to push climate activism with polar bears “dying” polar bear populations are thriving more than ever. there are species you could cite but polar bears aren’t one of them lol





so....grizzly and polar bears split less time than blacks and whites? cool.






12:00





i don’t think so.





grizlar





this is pseudo science





africans can breed with white people cant they:p





oh my goodness.  the bible explains all this (and you don't need millions of s and evolution). bible talks about global warming,  animal die offs and how it all ends.  read your bible girl... just take a look and see what you think 😉





please don't give furies ideas

by many accounts, we continue to be in a "recession". all news channels have an agenda and their spin. depending on ideology and political affiliation the news is shaped. your suggested channel is no different sadly

jeff who?

no good.

pizzly

pissly




















piss





human beings are made in the image of god. can we please stop with this idea of evolution? every living thing on earth was created by god. this is no religious thing. this is a relationship thing. this is fact. if you seek him, you’ll find him. jesus loves us. he wants to help us. without him, none of this would be here. we wouldn’t be here.

trophy hunters suck.





why are some animals breeds and others are different species… it’s just a different breed of bear like we’ve done with dogs





grizzlar





.





bears are bears not like horse and donkey , donkey and horse are different spieces but beads are same spiecds





hahaha hahaha hahaha what utter bs.





i really like your channel and the videos you're producing. however the narrator of this video put me to sleep because of her amateur repetitious, monotone style. you can do better





heelo people





pissly





omg this cant be right coz im a god lover and apparently evolution is made up yet out of necessity this animal has evolved wow lmao we come from chimps people

so scientific.  lol





the us is still in a recession. last video of yours i ever watch





"but what he killed instead...". uh no honey, there was nothing done in stead. that would imply a conscious choice of what he killed. you need to learn english. "what he actually killed was ..." would be the correct choice of words. but hey, you never went to college, i get that. but damn, you should have learned this in jr. high.





the accent, and the way she pronounces the word skull are so annoying.





you didn't take the time to look at polar bear population numbers. you might want to do so before simply 'believing' and running with it.





dogs ,cats,humans and a host many other animals have been cross breeding. this story is stupid.





no there messing around with d.n.a and we know this is what happened in the days of noah ,there is nothing new under the sun ,as in the days of noah so will be the coming of the son of man pray and repent .this is totally against out creator yahuah and his son our true messiah yahusha .read the book of enoch and find the truth .

real science eh.? you just brought politics into it. worst thing you could of done, now i have to question what's being said. and that news you are pushing any thing that talks positive about bazos and others you mentioned is going to be bad they are part of the reason you would wake up to people screaming at each other





its so freaking predictable that google has a pop up story today blaming inbreeding on humans due to climate change .
isn't that exactly why the dinosaurs became extinct. lmao





i don’t like the way evolution advocates present their unproven and unprovable theories as if they are scientifically accurate facts. you guys may believe whatever you want, but don’t present your religious beliefs as proven science!
