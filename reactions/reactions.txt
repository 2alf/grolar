Ok, just found out that the name depends on the species of the father. Therefore, if the male was a Polar bear, you get a Pizzly. It was he male was a Grizzly, you get a Grolar Bear.

A pizzly bear would be the first generation offspring of the hybridization between a male polar (ursus maritimus) and female grizzly (ursus arctos). A hybrid between a male U. arctos and female U. maritimus is called a grolar bear. Kind of like a lion(panthera leo)/tiger(panthera tigris) hybrid, the offsprings name starts with its father's name (male P. leo/female P. tigris hybrid=liger, male P. tigris/female P. leo hybrid=tigon). However, if the bear is a second generation hybrid, which it sounds like with a hybrid mother, I don't know what they would call that, but definitely not pizzly. Female tigons have been hybridized to produce a second generation hybrid called "litigon" crossed with male Asiatic lions, or "titigon" crossed with male tigers.

Yes, the climate is changing. It has before and after every Ice Age. The decline of Polar Bears has not been seen by the Inuit people because they can't avoid the Polar Bears to get out of town to investigate!

That is the only way different types of the same species will ever mate, humans force them to do so, as they have done over many decades with many animals. It will not happen otherwise. They breed them then let them loose and say "look, a new breed" or "type."

 @soldier7332  Fossils without seeing the breeding you mean? Collect bones, put them together as evolutionists wish and say, "look, a variable." The fact that many, many animals have died together and evolutionists pick and choose which bones they want and wish to support their agenda. Sure, what ever period you want, it's all lies and manipulation. Mathematics (applied to biology and physics) denies evolution TRILLIONS of times over the point of Probability, making evolution completely impossible, a fantasy. Start from the start, see where that takes you. Oh, yeah: absolutely no where. Fossilized/petrified trees found erect and straight upside down in sediment that is supposed to be tens and hundreds of millions years old. Sure. Soft tissue is impossible to be soft in bones that are supposed to be 60plus millions of years old: yeah, impossible. But then, to save her career and those who knew this find evolution false, of course had to change their tune and had to find a way to suit the agenda of evolution. This is just a fraction of the many facts and evidences proving evolution is a Total lie.

My fellow native American have a right to survive. If you don't want them killing the bears than donate food a supplies to them. You do it for everyone else. 🙄
