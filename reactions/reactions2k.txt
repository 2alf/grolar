We had Coyote/wolf mixes where I used to live. Smartest canines I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. They weren't afraid of humans, just cautious around us. They traveled in groups of 3 (6 total) and hunted the local foxes and cats out before going after the deer. There was one in particular that would try to "sneakily" follow me along the river bank. I say that with quotations because the  dingus was too big to hide in the bank grass lol

I'm surprised you didn't mention the coywolf. Also raccoons have been splitting into two species over the last few hundred years. The city raccoons are now faster in a drag race than their country cousins. Four-lane road crossings eliminated the slower ones from gene pool.

Thank you - Great episode - Perfect examples of how during different times of existence it's important to be able to be flexible - becoming a generalist and able to take advantage of anything that exists, in order to survive, while at times becoming a specialist for the purpose of differentiation and survival. This is both at a macro level (over long periods of time as animals adapt within their species to survive) as well as micro-level (with the individual human having to redefine our own skills to become more specialized as we search to find a career that will span more than just a couple of years). Change is constant - Thank you Real Science

My cousin has a hybrid snake. He took a male corn snake and mated it with a female black ratsnake. The resulting mixes were kind of strange looking and he kept 1 of them and sold the rest but he specifically sold them as hybrids. I don't know if they would be considered true hybrids though because a corn snake is technically a kind of ratsnake as well. Different ratsnakes and corn snakes have been known to mate in the wild occasionally as well.

But they said at their location now grizzlies outnumber polar bears by far! (~1:6)
Amazing how they are making their dens to hibernate through long arctic winters having no trees.

Pizzly and Grolar bears have two different body plans. The Pizzly has the body plan of a Polar bear, so it should have a close to the same lifestyle as the Polar bear. While the Grolar Bear has the body plan of a Grizzly, so it should have a lifestyle similar to that of a Grizzly. Both may be better suited to the Artic/sub-artic all the way down to more temperate climates. With the Pizzly staying more north while the Grolar moving further south. At least if the body plan is taken into account and that translates over to them, taking after one parent more than the other in their diets.

I don’t think it was a grizzly mix not that big, but it could have been a young one.  It walked just outside my back door. Grizzly’s are about 1000-1400 pounds really big, so are polar bears.

About the Polar Bear/Grizzly hybridization killing the Polar Bear as a species I think there is a flaw - as far as I know this only happens in North America and the Polar bear has a wide distribution around the Arctic - so the species would still exist there (since I assume the hybrid would not be traveling far outside it's habitat to go on sea ice, like the Polar Bear would)

First off I want to say that I have thoroughly enjoyed your videos including this one. However, I have heard that Polar bear populations have been steadily increasing. I quickly googled "polar bear population graph" and the couple links I clicked on supported what I have heard. I am not a climate change denier but have heard that connection between warming oceans hasn't negatively affected polar bears the same across their ranges. I did find that in less than half of their sub-ranges the numbers are declining while over half have stable or increasing populations. If you could do some research on this and get back to me I would appreciate it. Again great work!

Well, its be going on for a long time. In the 80's I morphed into the hybrid known as Monkey-Pony, long before grizzles started boning polar bears. Monkey-Pony had thousands of chromosomes and he was a joy and a terror. He was officially assassinated in Gatlinburg, Tennessee in 1986 on Halloween night, his Acura Legend flipping down a snowy mountain. I woke up 3 months later and monkey-pony was no more. Today was the first time I have even begun to understand that hybrid mutation again, thanks to this video. Neeeeheeeeoooooowwwwaaahhhhaaa! He may be reborn, pray it happens! Peace

This video let me on a wild research to find out what about hybridization on wolves, coyotes, and dogs. I for one, am 30% confident that my dog has some coyote ancestry. And even the vet told me that he suspected that my dog was probably the offspring of a coyote (my dog is the offspring of a house dog, and a street dog(?) in an area where coyotes are plentiful). It is not uncommon to see coyotes running around with other street dogs.

Coywolves (Coyote x wolves) tend to pop up as well, especially along the geographical edges where the two populations intermingle. In fact, a decent portion of red and eastern wolves have coyote genetics. This makes Coywolves larger than coyotes, smaller than wolves, and they form more cohesive social units. I live in the Great Lakes region, so it strikes me as interesting just how many hybrids exist.

What this video doesn't tell you: Polar Bear numbers are skyrocketing, and by 2030, they're expected to pass Grizzlies in population for the first time ever (despite the fact that Grizzles are also doing well). The actual reason for increased hybridization is the expansion of their range and the explosion of their population.

A brown bear and a Polar Bear are a Species in the same Genus. Many Species in the same Genus are very capable of mating and producing fertile offspring. African Cichlids have an "order" in which they will cross. If you have a tank with breeding group from the same Genus, your chances of crossing rise, so does the aggression. If every group if from a different Genus that chance goes down drastically. They are all from the same Family though, so one genus may have species that are closely related to each other. The hybrid brown/polar bear has siblings and at least one is unrecognizable as a hybrid by sight. Just as hybrid fish. The mother will have fry from the same clutch, some will look exactly like mom, some dad and some a mix. Hybrids exist everywhere, just because humans can't differentiate by sight, doesn't mean they don't exist.

In my bio book I remember it talked about how Charles Darwin observed two different species of birds who ended up mating with one another the offspring ended up with a different 'song' from the parents and the behavior was somewhere between the two. Perhaps instead of looking at this from the perspective of "oh no an endangered species might go extinct sooner because it's breeding with another species" we should instead embrace that change. Honestly humans are a huge reason this is happening anyways and animals are just trying to find a way to exist...Another example the CA condor no longer need males to mate a can reproduce A sexually. Overall nature is screaming thats change is coming things are getting warmer and they are just doing there best to adapt we should not interfere with this process and should let the 2 merge...plus the offspring will be stronger that gene pool larger. I say the same about other hybrids out there... what I don't like is the term 'purebred' that gives the notion that these wondrous creatures of evolution are a mistake, but they aren't. Last comment why not give this developing species its own name instead of a half baked one that is incredibly stupid 🙄  interesting video overall though definitely food for thought.

Let’s imagine that this is an evolutionary trait, in the negative timeline direction.  

Similar to albinism, when species split, they end up moving away from the herd to survive.  Eventually multiple herds will force out the albino, and at some point two can find each other and reproduce, and eventually dominant genetics replace the albinism.  

This would allow for a new “species” to evolve from multiple generations of survival, and allowing for two of the dominant genetic specimens to rebuild the bridge where the origin species can once again roam the earth.

Hybrids aren't very common in mammals but are common in birds. Very common in some families. Check out the gull hybrids of western North America. There are a lot of them and one of the most common has parents which aren't even each other's closest relatives. The problem with "species" is that it is a human concept. In nature, species exist on a spectrum.

while we are still trying to figure out if human activity is leaning to increased rates of polar ice loss, we are still technically in an ice age, just the end of it. the ice was destined to disappear eventually, and so it's probably better for the polar bears if it happened now, rather than when they become incompatible

Genetically speaking it is theoretically possible to make a human/chimpanzee hybrid that would be entirely sterile. While theoretically possible, ethically it has yet to be put into practice, hopefully it never is, as the offspring would be neither human nor chimp, it would be a horrible existence.


Great video btw :)

Bears are cute, but the disappearance of sea ice doesn't bother them they can swim for 2 weeks straight without rest and if you check their populations  today they are doing really really good despite the ice melting. The reason they are ending up south in alaskan cities is they were pushed off by a stronger bear's territory,  they end up in human settlements because of over population and need to be culled before they get out of control.

The hybrid may also gain genetic immunity from the diseases prevalent in each parent's niche, allowing it to better 'fit' in an ecologically dynamic landscape.
For instance, the circus could charge folks a buck to peek behind the curtain at 'em... you just don't get that kind of drawing power with your run-of-the-mill variety critter.

Is "Grizzly" being used as a shorthand for all three brown bear subspecies? It's surprising that a polar bear would travel so far inland to mate with a grizzly when the coastal browns would be far more accessible.

I was like, "wtf is a beluga school or narwhal school? And how does one just hang them on a wall?" [Was listening without watching the video]
I guess she's saying "skull" but I damn sure heard "school"!

Also, "pizzly" and "grolar" are not interchangeable. Like most hybrids, with the only exception I'm aware of being the mule- the offspring of a male donkey and female horse, hybrid names depend on the sex of the parents and their species. The reason there are 2 names for a hybrid is to be specific about its parentage. For example, "liger" refers to the offspring of a male lion and female tiger; where "tigon", is the reverse pairing of a male tiger and female lion. 
So a "pizzly" is the offspring of a male polar bear and female grizzly. Conversely, the 8 hybrids found to be the offspring of a single female polar bear have grizzly fathers and thus all 8 are "grolar bears". Hybrids with names formed by combining the parents' species names begin with the father's species followed by the mother's. Having 2 names reduces confusion and tells which genders were which in species pairings.

And, just for fun, the counterpart to a mule (and are less common than mules) is called a "hinney". That is sort of a mix of "horse" (just the "h"), and the name for a female donkey, which is called a "jenny". No idea why the "e" was replaced with an "i" for the naming though...

It sounds to me like we need to revise our definition of what a "species" is if certain animals can hybridize. Also, to confirm: Can the grolar bear create fertile offspring? I was wondering that the whole video, but you never confirmed it. Perhaps the implication was there, but I wasn't sure.

Creation Scientists have been pointing out hybrids for decades. They really undermine the species definition but also open up lots of exciting adaptive possibility. Hybrids explain how a diverse population can rapidly segregate into subspecies after a bottleneck. Hybrids also allow fast adaptation during climate change. Trying out new phenotypes and accessing genetic knowledge from that ancestral diverse population will allow them to survive in a changing world.

A mule is NOT merely the offspring of a horse and a donkey. It's the offspring of a MARE (female horse) and a JACK (male donkey). The offspring of a Stallion (male horse) and a Jenny (female donkey) is called a hinny not a mule. :) I remember it this way: Mule (with an M) comes from a Mare (with an M), and by extension, a jack. Hinny (ending in Y) comes from a Jenny (ending in Y) and by extension, a stallion.

I saw a video about polar bear- grizzley bear crosses. It said that, when ice is little to none, polar bears have gone inland for food, and bred with grizzlies. Later, when the ice returned, the crosses went back out, and nature selected again the palest ones as the most successful hunters, since they had the best camoflage against the snow, which lived, forming again, over time, the polar bears. This was thought to have enabled the survival of the polar bear over periods of global warming.

This means that hunting crosses needs to be banned, or polar bears will die out, because they won't hunt well in forests, because they are too obvious to prey, being so big and pale. They will all die of starvation, reliing on the crosses to carry their genes on, and if the crosses die out from human hunting, then the polar bear will die out with them!

I am a naturalist and I believe in conservation to certain extent. The problem I have with our current ideal of conservation is that we want everything to stay relatively the same as it is now and that is just not how nature works. And also some species naturally keep a lower number but that doesn't mean they are necessary endangered. We should try to minimize our effect on natural ecosystems and that means allowing species to go extinct and allowing for new species to emerge. That's the ideal of a naturalist. Still I like your vid it's great, no shade.

seems like the concept of 'species' will also have to go. it could make more sense to speak of 'lines' on somewhat fractally organized cladograms, and those lines might be typologized by their tendencies to split or to fuse, inner complexity, or whatever. some observable qualitative characteristics. and basically, thicker lines should be formed by thinner, lower level lines, all the way down to individuals and genes, and maybe something else. wouldn't it be nice to have a huge, scalable, and collectively editable graph for that 🤔

Our definitions of the divisions of living things is purely artificial. In nature there is no well defined barrier between the divisions, but rather they diffuse from one into another. And should the genetic differences not be too great, reproductively viable matings can occur (and will if given the chance).  Hybrids are quite common, many have been taking place since the retreat of the last glaciers which geographically separated and isolated populations. Under such situations the genetics of the population will "drift" away from that of the original population. Once the physical barrier to mating has been removed this can increase the genetic variation of the resulting population. This is generally a good thing from a survival stand point. Human are the result of several hybridizations.

I'm surprised that the divergence of polar bears from the common stock with brown bears goes back as far as 150 thousand years...

Any glacial interlude (the last one ended only 14K years ago and there have been others in the last 150K) would effectively squeeze polar bears (and their aquatic prey) out of much if not all of the Arctic Ocean (including Hudson's Bay) and drive them south - e.g. to the Alaskan archipelago and icy points further south along the West coast in the pacific and similar margins in the North Atlantic - so it's quite likely there have been repeated bouts of hybridization in the past that have worked to keep the two "isolated" quasi-species close enough both for hybridization to happen when the environment is changing and (during the subsequent interglacial) for parts of the resulting population to convergently re-evolve the white coloration and other adaptations to a purely Arctic lifestyle fairly rapidly (whether through mating with any remaining pure polar bear populations of perhaps just through the reemergence of latent genetic lines helpful for an Arctic lifestyle from the hybrid population itself).

It would be interesting to see research on any "ancient" DNA that might be discovered from brown bears and polar bears from different interglacial periods to see if there were a bear equivalent of our Neanderthal and Denisovan hybrid ancestry.

hybrids is what helps with evolution at times, I mean, look at humans. We mixed with Neanderthals, Denisovans, and two other unnamed hominids. The Pizzly is just a start of a new line of bear that will generically diverge into a new species. Honestly, I think hybridism is over looked ALOT of the history of evolution. So doesn't that mean Pizzly would have 'two' common ancestors 

Domesticated Arctic dogs have 1.4% taiymer wolf in their genetics, were other dogs dont. Wolfdogs are hybrids, some people try to argue they are the same and not a hybrid. It is, just like a Coydog. Not to mention the constant hybridization of plants. I have seen photos of a tarantula hybrid of p.Irminia and p.Cambridgei, though it was sterile. Actually, now that I remember, hybridization was a HUGE touchy subject in the tarantula hobby. lol

I think we can use ram pumps to solve the energy crisis. First we build a hollow cylindrical tower out at sea, to a depth of say 1100m. The tower is open to the air at the top and has a sealed base at the bottom. We drill a hole about 20m below the surface and feed water into the tower. The water falls down a pipe for about 200m where it powers a turbine that is connected to an electricity generator. We collect the water and drop it down a pipe for another 200m to another turbine. We do this twice more until we are getting electricity from four generators.
We then drop the water another 200m to power a turbine which drives a cog that is geared to turn a disc at the base of the tower. The waste water from the last turbine starts to collect at the bottom of the tower creating a shallow reservoir that we need to pump out.
The rotating disc at the base of the tower has cams along its edge. These cams are used to push pistons outwards. These pistons are in cylinders built into the wall in a circular formation. The cylinders are sealed at the interior side apart from where a piston rod enters to push the piston outward. The outside of the piston head is exposed to the deep sea water. 
The cam will push the piston outward against the high pressure deep sea water. An inlet pipe will take water from our shallow reservoir which will be pulled into the space created in the cylinder, behind the piston head. When the cam releases the piston, the low pressure water inside the cylinder will be the only thing pushing the piston out against the high pressure deep sea water.
This is when the system acts as a ram pump.
The piston will be forced inward and will force the low pressure water back out through the inlet pipe toward the reservoir. The inlet pipe will now act the same as a waste pipe in a ram pump and the flowing water will shut a waste valve. The remaining water in the cylinder will be forced through a check valve into a pipe and upwards to the surface.
The larger the diameter of the tower, the more cylinders that can be built into the wall at the base of the tower.
I realise that the ram pump cylinder will pump more of its water back into the reservoir than it sends to the surface but we can always add more cylinders to the system. We can even put another layer of cylinders above the original ones as ram pumps still work underneath shallow water.
I think we should be able to pump water upwards at the same rate that it falls into the bottom of the tower and so keep the reservoir nice and shallow.
Now, if I understand the maths correctly, we might only be able to pump the water near to the surface. In that case, we can pump the water into a reservoir tank (inside the tower) and use the electricity generated by the first turbine to pump out the tank.
This will leave us with 3 generators worth of electricity for every tower built.
Would this work? Everyone, please comment.

Otters and Racoons both have 38, the same as tigers and lions 🤔 

The American black bear also has 74 along with the polar and brown. 

78 is quite interesting and involves a lot of the dog breeds. Dingos in Australia have bred with all sorts of domestic dog breeds

Coywolf is an informal term for a canid hybrid descended from coyotes, eastern wolves and gray wolves. All members of the genus Canis are closely genetically related with 78 chromosomes and therefore can interbreed.[1] One genetic study indicates that these two species genetically diverged relatively recently (around 55,000–117,000 years ago). Genomic studies indicate that nearly all North American gray wolf populations possess some degree of admixture with coyotes following a geographic cline, with the lowest levels occurring in Alaska, and the highest in Ontario and Quebec, as well as Atlantic Canada.[2]

The answer for the bears is easy.  The ice caps are melting because we are still coming out of the last ice age and the polar bears are moving to the landmass coast away from the ice.   Which allows them to encounter grizzly bears.   The ice will be gone eventually but the good news is the animals on the ice are not stupid, they know when to leave their habbitat. The bad news is we may see pizzly bears and polar bears

Maybe breeding like this is how evolution always has been.
First, a species evolves into two as they split paths
Later, somehow and sometime those two species meet again and breed
Then a new species adapted to new things appears, and then it all repeats again.

There are even more where those came from you should see flying spiders mating season is is insane

ABC Island bears have a genetic structure that relates them not only to brown bears but polar bears as well. they aren't a "pizzly". theyre a product of an isolated population of polar bears interbreeding with the more common brown bear population.. they're not as extreme a hybrid like a "pizzly' or "liger" but they are hybrids and they do reproduce.

While the Biological Species Concept is still taught in high school and undergrad it has largely been abandoned in professional circles as there are far too many exceptions to it, and, additionally, it doesn't take into account asexually reproducing species, of which there are many.

It's also worth noting that in very rare instances Mules and Hinnys are fertile and can produce fertile offspring.  It's uncommon, but it has been documented.

Hybridization as an evolutionary strategy makes a lot of sense. One species adapting to changes is slow and can be easily wiped out by sudden environmental changes. If one species splits apart into maybe a dozen subspecies that each adapt to a specific environment, if a disaster strikes they can interbreed and create hybrids with several specific adaptations and have a better change of surviving. Even though the specialized subspecies may disappear, their genes will be passed on.

This is why we need to change rhe definition of a species. There are exceptions to the rule, so the rule doesn't work.

We either need to consider them the same species if they can create viable offspring, or decide that different species can make viable offspring

Some female hybrids can have babies, female liger and female tigon can have liliger, litigon, l3liger, tiliger, titigon, they exist. So they are a 2nd and 3rd generation. 

Maybe , 3 o more generation can breed between them and made new species between lion and tiger (not liger and tigon, but a new species who have baby with female and male together)

Warming climates drive arctic species further south because melting sea ice means less "land" to stand and hunt on, at the same time the warmer climate opens northern latitudes to warmer weather species. Similar species hybridize, and hybrids that aren't quite suited for true arctic conditions are set to take the stage because it allows them to bring adaptations from their warmer cousins to the warming arctic which might allow them to better survive the wetter conditions or leave them altogether.

Hybridization might actually be a way for two similar species to sidestep into a completely new niche and eventually evolve enough to become their own species, a way to avoid the threat of extinction by completely stiring up the gene pool which might lead to more random mutation which might in turn lead to better adaptability to this new climate. Sure hybrids usually can not reproduce but if you have a large number of hybrids (and it is driven by natural pressures such as climate change/food scarcity/habitat reduction) you only need 1 to be born fertile for the beginnings of a new hybrid species. And while we get hybridization often enough to classify these hybrids, changing evolutionary pressures can drive hybridization up through being pushed into each other territories or there simply aren't enough of their own species around. And genetics are a lottery, in order for the hybrids to get good mutations to help them reproduce there has to be a lot of attempts. You have to play the lottery to win it, more hybrids means more chances for mutations. Obviously some hybrids have better chances then others. Honestly im amazed Mules work at all, like how lucky do you have to be at genetic lottery to have different numbers of chromosomes and really the only notable common defect is infertility

Grizzlies are not being pushed north due to development. At least not in Canada. I don't think you understand how sparsely populated the Canadian north is relative to it's size.  Also, we have been told that polar bear populations are about to be wiped out for a long time now and it isn't happening.  I think the possibility exists that climate change could really hurt them, but it simply hasn't happened yet.  According to the WWF, populations are just fine.

A wonder how far invetrofertilization has come in the animal kingdom, as to when there is a limit on the number of species, the animals are near extinction. Albeit the number of human beings focused on this ‘type’ of work, it is important for human collaboration to occur, as to the sharing of ideas and assistance towards the efforts. The most recent report of the extinct 🦏 rhino and other animals has to encourage human eyes and minds open to new solutions, thus no one finds themselves with a hand count or one or two animals who are both tired and old, later dying, gone extinct. Why it matters if the earth has animals on it? Sure seems it would be very disappointing if the human species went to the local zoo or traveled through the safari, and there was nothing to see, no animals or even so a select specific species. Any of the animals, gone extinct, it would be upsetting, to tell kids they will never see another type of animal in their lifetime, in the future, seems upsetting. Animal preservation is important, overpopulation no, but the right balance of creation/procreations, is. 🐣🐥.

My analogy from this is what if two different species do have the capability of mating would that mean that it’s capable of us being able to evolve and mate with a different species as well since polar bears r going extinct evolution was involved. Chromosome don’t match up once there a hybrid but what if 2 hybrids mate then the chromosomes would match up exactly giving the animal capability of having or producing baby’s

Years ago they studied DNA of polar bears and brown bears.  Polars bears are brown bears that evolved to have light coloured fur for camouflage just as evolution does for other species.  Of course different bears can mate.  They are all the same species.

What makes me sad about this video - is that, in the beginning, it's mentioned that some hunter 'shot' one of these bear hybrids. 
This chance of hybridisation might be the polar bear's only way of preserving its DNA for the time being (while we're currently throwing the planet on the dung heap), with the opportunity to re-speciate at a later date (should we finally pull our fingers out and start doing something to reverse environmental damage).
However, you can bet that hunters, who really don't need to nail another head on their walls, will now be turning their attention to getting the latest 'fashion' in trophies.
These hybrids should be protected by international law and any hunters caught killing or maiming them should pay heavily for their actions.

When they looked at the genes of wisents which are european bisons. They find out that wisents have only 10 percent bison genes. The rest are cow genes. So wisents have a similar history als pizzly bears. Compare pictures of wisents with pictures of bisons and cows and you will see that a wisent looks like a hybrid.

Here is where evolution makes no sense: The video claims that during the ice age brown bears adapted to their environment, somehow their fur turning white, skin black and getting physically larger, yet the concern she gives for polar bears not being cable of achieving the same adaptation change to their new environment is questionable. So someone explain to how an intensely drastic change in environment somehow gave enough time for a brown bear to turn into what we now know as a polar bear, but a polar bear today can't go through the same evolutionary changes?

It is not like there is a specific drive for individual animals to improve through breeding. They see an animal meeting their requirements to take care of their needs. No population that naturally formed just thought it would be good to mix. If a population outlives another one it is because their environment changed in a way that favored certain traits. 
At the same time, not every species needs to survive. If there is no place for them, they die out. And that's just how it is. If there is no room for them to meet their requirements, why torture them.

Oh. So its literally impossible for evolution or huge mutations to happen at once unless if hybridization is possible of course. It has to be very slow and gradual in order for the chromosomes to pair up and create a fertile offspring?

Major problem for students and teachers of evolution. Can only breed within a ‘species’ or ‘kind’. This allows birds fish animals to adapt to climate needs only. But not into another kind or species. All my 74yrs I listen as they call the difference between “an apple” and “an orange” a missing link. Of course it’s “missing” it ain’t there.

As climate change warms the earth the polar bears might have to be moved south to the south pole, if they are to survive at all...
In a perfect world, we would stop this human predatory behavior but until we find a way to deal with the human condition,  we will forever go round and round...
we are self serving first, we will do whatever it takes to provide for our own needs both real and imagined and only once they have been met do we worry about anyone else or the bigger picture. 
This IS the human condition.  
This is what stops us from correcting our past- present and future mistakes. 
IF we could terraform Mars or any other planet than why not start here on earth first? 
It's not a reality, that's why.
 Just another slight of hand trick, to distract us from the fact the planet is dying and corporate greed and western consumerism is leading us all down that path to hell....
Has anyone considered many of these northern animals travel across the ice back znd forth between Canada, Greenland znd Russia? Russia has had so many nuclear disasters ( we only heard about the ones they couldn't cover up, as they were seen from space - there were as many as 35!!! Beginning just after ww2) these nuclear plants are on the water, and just like Japan have been flushing waste water into the artic ocean for decades...this is going to effect every animal in the north...birth defects were noticeable on dead baby whales, narwhal, seals znd a few 3 eyed fish back in the late 1980's when I worked for the explorer Inn ( yellow knife nwt - we did hunts from Alert out on the ice for spoiled wealthy american trophy hunters, hunting north America's big 5 ) 
All I am saying is there are other reasons for some of these changes seen in northern species than inter breeding

Why is losing the polar bear "undoubtedly a terrible tragedy"? Something like 99.9% of species are extinct was each of those loses a terrible tragedy too? We've all grown up with the understanding that those incapable of adapting to their changing environment lose the game of evolution. That fact in of itself is the driving force of evolution, it's the reason we're here now to witness that fact. 

If anything we should be loudly celebrating the genetic viability of the grolar bears because both species of bears get to keep evolving, it's like they got a 1up in the game of evolution.

I mean when you think of it, human race is equal to different species of animals.. i mean we see different races of people interbreed and make kids, animals of different species should be able to do the same as long as they are of the same circle. Human + human = human so polar + grizzly = pizzly/grolar. Similar could happen with other animals as long as they are in the circle of relation.

It's almost like the ice caps naturally come and go over centuries, and animals adapt on their own and we don't need to try to intervene all of the time. Maybe we should accept that the environment changes constantly and learn how to adapt instead of doubling down and insisting that we are causing these natural changes and we have to stop them from happening.

Kinda wild polar bears and brown bears only split 150,000 years ago. Humans the migrated out of Africa 150,000-200,000 years ago to eventually create Europeans and Asians and Americans. Does that mean different human races could be nearly as different as a polar bear is from a brown bear?

Less than two minutes in, the fact that scientists don’t agree on what a species is plagues the video. The idea that species cannot cross, as the video presents, is only true if a species is defined like how we were taught in school - a group of organisms which can breed reproductively fit organisms. However, when scientists refer to polar bears and grizzlies as separate species, that is not what they mean. They simply mean that these two bears are genetically and geographically distinct populations through natural selection. That definition doesn’t prohibit hybridization at all.

You can see this really well when it comes to brambles (Rubus). These plants are divided into many species using definition 2. However, most of these species can cross with each other and bear fertile offspring. So if we go by definition 1, most brambles are the same species.

It’s not nearly as surprising that polar bears and brown bears can cross when you understand that.

Man, some of these commenters are so ignorant about the environment and animal conservation.  There is nothing wrong with modern day trophy hunting.  In many places it is the lifeblood of conservation.  And in most cases, it helps to control overpopulation.

They are conflating trophy hunting with poaching, which are two distinct and separate things.  Further, they seem ignorant of how the environment and ecosystems work.  As if the only “correct” environment is that which existed when they are alive.  That’s a giant experiential bias.  There is no “correct” ecosystem.  The only correct environments are those in which our human species can survive and thrive.  Along the way some species will go extinct, others won’t.  Not all species, or all breeds of species must survive.   That’s all in your naive little minds. Some really arent necessary or are easily replaced, others are necessary and impossible to replace.  Conflating them all as if every species is as important as the next is just the highest level of ignorance.  And no, we can’t save them all, nor do we need to.

Why do people think it's ok to kill for sport? Animals aren't our toys and we shouldn't be hunting them for anything but food if we absolutely have to. These types of things piss me off. The only reason you should ever kill an animal is to either defend yourself or your loved ones or for survival. If you're in the wild and have to defend your life I understand, but we can't keep doing things like this. Murder is murder idc what species you are.

Well...
We humans are hybrids too.
Neanderthalers mated with a new version of humans.
Africans mate with whites and produce hybrids.
Asians mate with hispanics, and so on and produce hybrids.
Aboriginals and so on...
Why on earth is that necesary?
Well...ask them why they had sex together?
We humans allways want good reasons to explain something. Is it useful? Is it this or that? 
You know...sometimes you need to let go why and why not things happen and just let life be.

You found 1 hybrid so I guess that's how evolution works, lol.  You basically stated that it's impossible for it to breed so I guess that's been immediately debunked but then you theorize about how that could have been how species evolved.  You proved that theory wrong then thought it could have been how things happened, so which is it?

12:34 😂 comical! All of this mixing filth is just like in the days of Noah! 

Jasher 4:18-19 KJVA

18 And their judges and rulers went to the daughters of men and took their wives by force from their husbands according to their choice, and the sons of men in those days took from the cattle of the earth, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and taught the MIXTURE of ANIMALS of ONE SPECIES WITH THE OTHER, in order therewith to 👉🏾 provoke the Lord👈🏾; and God saw the whole earth and it was CORRUPT, for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon earth, all men and all animals.

19 And the Lord said, I will blot out man that I created from the face of the earth, yea from man to the birds of the air, together with cattle and beasts that are in the field for I repent that I made them.

Genesis 6:1-7 KJV — And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

Matthew 24:36-44 KJV — But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.

Joel 3:13 KJV — Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.

Joel 3:16 KJV — The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.

Joel 3:20-21 KJV — But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. For I will CLEANSE THEIR BLOOD that I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.

STOP MIXING!!!!

Bear = bear? Or animal? 
Polar = race?
Grizly = race?
Polar + Grizly = hybrid?

Human = human? 
Pakistani = race?
Norwegian = race?
Pakistani + Norwegian = hybrid?

Or did i do the math wrong, maybe this is right?

Polar = White?

Grizly = black?

Grizly + polar = hybrid? Multicultural? Mixed race?

Im not gonna do the other one again, do you understand my question?
What is different between human races and animal races? We humans clearly have different looks and figures too, just as animals, and why can animals be hybrid, but we humans are too butthurt to be called something easy as that, instead we need to heal the wound with a beautiful and complicated word and explaination..
