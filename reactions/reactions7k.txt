so it's basically a polar bear but for warmer weather 😭
If I die bc of a Pizzly bear - i cant say that i’d be mad. Bc that thing is adorable
I mean at this point we kinda deserve it
Yeah we had this one coming
Nah, I think there's still worse to come
😂✌️
lightskin bears...
If not friend why friend shaped
This is what we get for Global Warming. Glolar Bear: Earths Revenge
Grizzly bears are already 10% polar bear
Can the hybrids bread with other hybrids or not
Pizzly/grolar bears are sweeties!
don't worry, I speak bear
Our savior
I don’t think people realize how serious this could get 😅
I want one as a pet
OSITOS NESQUIK
yeeeaaahhhh....polar bears actively hunt for humans soo...I don't think it's good that they are coming down😅
GROLAR BEARS AND PRIZZLY BEARS
@heba_ahmed omg me as a bear 🤭
Polar bears smarts with a grizzlys bronze
polar bears population has been in an incline since the 50s there’s more polars bears than ever...
NOOOO THOSE THINGS ARE GONNA BE SO MEAN OMG😭 Grizzlies are big and polar bears are big and aggressive ASFFF😭
@moonlight ale słodkie
@Feleo bruhhh
If it’s so bad then why do I wanna give it a lil kissy kiss 🖐🏼😩
• enemies
Agradecida de vivir en LATAM
nesquik... 😭
I love your content but calling bears "abominations"? you've crossed the line
Grizzly and polar bears I have a fear of more than any other animal and now you’re telling me there’s a hybrid of the two combined?! 😭
And we deserve it.
That’s what humans get for melting that bears home😅
Lucky I live in Texas
I want a prizzly bear
Da haben wir den 🥗
she’s biracial
Bearacial
I sense "light skin bear memes" in the future
Bears have no prejudiced and make a high breed BUT mankind...forget about it
I want u to explain everything lol so entertaining 🤣
It’s what we deserve
Please no
Logic Bears😳
Haha bearacial
Save artica
not in Australia bro
pissly bears oh wait-
@chamomile_system_ pizzly
sounds like another situation currently happening 😅
First up How did the "interaction" even took place
@yoonbums_juicyankles why-
@call.me_anni this feels like we r living in a simulation
These have been around for a while, but they’re relatively new, but what he’s saying is scary and sadly true
We hace a polar brown bear mix at my zoo, dunno why they let it happen
@zion2061 😁😁😁
my great grandpa was in his house and he say a polar bear coming and the bear banged on the walls and my gramps put his ear to the wall and heard....
Un tysmé sucré ça 🥲
Moving south has never seemed like a better choice
...is it a skinned bear at the beginning...
I've read 3 sentences of this article and I'm like "what in the crap"
Yup, we’re all gonna die
Now we have to worry about the bears evolving??
It’s a PISSED OFF POLAR BEAR ON STEROIDS!!!!
I’m from Northern Canada. I promise they won’t make it far south. They’ll stick to the snow.
It’s not like polar bears only live in the snow. They live in grasslands and tundras as well.
I’m good, no thank you
@irwinlaner looks like I need to add something new to my list of irrational fears
What about the fires down there? I heard the bears make it way south
Exactly!!! They probably think it’s hell on earth down there and head right back up
Right! We have it bad enough without hybrid bears🙄
I love it!
I. Want. One
Imagine having to explain to your insurance company that your car was destroyed by a grizzly bear and a polar bear hybrid 😂
Where is this global warming everyone is talking about?
Just when you thought the 2020s couldn’t get any weirder
*Waiting for someone to say "we're the virus"* 
This sounds like a fantasy creature wth is it doing in reality
bruhhh what
This sounds like a made-up headline. You sure this is real?
Wellllll, now it’s just getting ridiculous
Hmmm a new animal to be terrified of. Fantastic!
Okay I'm not even joking but I'm low key about to cry. I'm not ready for bears.
The world is officially ending. See y’all in another life ✌🏽
Bears really about to conquer the world. First clowns, now bears.
I hope they're cute.
Imagine if you see that bear
Oh hell no
Sooooo should I not go hiking anymore?
how do you even get a hybrid bear? like were they put in the same enclosure or what???
bro my mom made the same joke she said it’s gonna be called a pissly bear😭
noo that's a dream of mine 
They just want hugs and snacks
Can they have babies together? I want to see the baby
haha bears go brrrr
i was really gonna go camping in alaska this summer but- 😳
and i wanted to go to alaska
Not sure what to put here.
I'm safe; I live in Michigan. Nothing ever happens in Michigan.
Honestly, let 'em take us out 🤷🏽‍♀️
Wait if it’s a crossbreed between bears, would they be infertile because they aren’t the same, like a liger please answer
They really said piss bear... Also, what's the difference between pizzly and grolar?
Americans and Canadians are scared of Australian animals, but our bears are tiny, slow, and vegetarian.
@emmalucia_ferguson we are fucked
Are pizzly bears fertile though? Usually, when two different species have a hybrid, usually they cannot reproduce (mule, liger, etc.)
It's always the lightskins who are dangerous.
This nonsense gonna be in your backyard sooner 😭
This is white genocide; Stormfront was right all along.
Brown guys only want white girls 😞
Can a pizzly and a pizzly make a baby, or are they sterile like mules?
The info: 😥‼️😣😰👿🏴‍☠️🔪🪓❌🚩. The music: 😁💖💖🤧🤧🥳🥳😍😍😂🤪😜🦄🌝🌈🌈
Whole-ass Pokémon names.
Me in Africa worrying about animals that probably won't kill me 👈
Climate change is just the earth's back-up plan in case humans mess up.
You can call them "grolars" or "puzzles"; I call them "karma."
We did this to ourselves; we deserve to get clapped by these hybrids.
You guys know the ice caps have been melting since the last ice age, right? We just sped things up.
Pizzley bears...
Soooo can these things have babies, or are they sterile like mules?
Pissly bears...
Pandas already biracial, but this is horrendous.
So can these hybrid offspring themselves produce viable offspring or no because they are two different species?
We don't take care of nature; nature adapts. At this rate, the animals could evolve to hunt us. The age of man is here, and it's all downhill to extinction.
No jungle fever jokes? Sheeesh. The times have changed lol
Is this the race replacement conspiracy but with bears?
So play dead or pray?
And once again, the lightskins get all the good genes.
New bear just dropped.
Yeahhh, we're fucked.
We kinda deserve it, so I say let them come.
I mean, if you think about it, we asked for it, so now we're f*cked up.
LIGHTSKIN BEARS.
Nature said f*ck you, and I respect it for that.
Im more worried about a lightskin bear takin my girl than my head.
Naw, they RIZZLY bears now.
They Polar bears in Grizzly bear territory. Oh well, new apex pred 😭
look, it's not nature doing this; it's the GOVERNMENT.
Which one comes first, pizzly or grolar bear? Which one went on an interracial thingy?
It's called diversity.
Beautiful fur color. Let’s hope they won’t be hunted to extinction for it.
The two most aggressive bear types interbreed; are you kidding me 😭 humanity is screwed.
Yeah, this is convincing me that mother nature has been trying to kill us for a while now.
"LIGHTSKIN BEARS," AHHAHAHAHAHA.
I live in the desert.
We kinda did this one to ourselves.
What “SOME” White Americans are afraid of😅
It's so sad that polar bears are going extinct because we can't take responsibility for our part in global warming. 🥺
So... we forced a natural hybrid that can wipe us out... good to know
mad
I keep saying it. I keep saying it. We keep on fucking with Gaia, she gets hers. And we don't know how to match her mean streak. Just saying.
@winter_117_
Is it true that we gone be outta fish in 2048? I ain't slept in two days sir. I need answers
can you do a raccoon vid? plsss
some white person is gonna want one as a pet
We had this one coming
So, mixed race bears lol
this has been happening since like 2016
I got to see you talk about ligers.
You forgot to mention that they can breed with each other. So this is a fertile crossbreed like the coywolf
ok
Why does a Grolar sound like a zombie name from days gone
You make the best videos
Gronola Bears
Ayo this monster hunter? we got whole ass subspecies popping up
@ilyserpo @biggynostrils @aceyyyyyyyyyyy @xenocresent cool
polar bears are one of the few animals that see us as food, because food is so scarce in their habitat they'd take anything
weren't polar bears evolved from grizzlies from migration to the north? now they're just coming back and making another species of bears
good, I hope they eat us all. humans are overrated and need to go.
polar bears are just grizzlies adapted to the cold so it’s not really too bad but it’s definitely not good 😂
chopper gunner inbound
Whatdidhesayyyyy 😭😭
Are the hybrids infertile, or no?
I literally read an article about this in stem today
So these Grolar bears could drive cars now.......fml
NO
lol sound like what's going on with people now
the cafe music got me
it is time the 2 families reunited after an eon apart.
Nesquik bears 😭😭😭
Bears are down with the swirl 😉
just call em lightskin bears
imagine one of them makes their way to Florida
I’m late as hell
Oh yeah. I seen this and was waiting for you to make a video on this
Bad for us and we’d deserve it
I want to fight them
Yeet
If we evolved from monkeys why are there still monkeys on earth
prizzly is the correct answer
I’m excited for them to start the next war... if you thought the Australian emu war was crazy just wait
Life finds a way 😂 still wanna hug it!
@fastestrainbowdash1988
Nature is really trying is best to erase us from earth uh
Granola bears✨
lightskin bears
Can they have babies?
oh b o y
Many have been found in the wild?
Nature is really trying is best to erase us from earth uh
And they actively hunt humans!
Y’all know kodiaks are bigger than grizzlys
That Jurassic park reference was fire.
Pizzly is just not ... not a good name
Is this what spirit bears are?
we have had them. not a lot
The chances are low.... But never none
I want more information on this 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
It’s polar grizzly, no one can tell me anything different😂, and I’ve seen one of these guys in person there scary as fuck 😳
I mean Idk...mother nature is making mens members smaller and less "potent" She's just done with us. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You know what, I don’t even mind anymore. Just let this beige snuggle fiend rip my head off, it’s fine.
So like Neanderthal dying out into Homo sapiens?
Still so cute🥰
I WANT TO HUG THEM SO FRICKIN MUCH! THEY ARE SO FUCKING CUTE
Yay I’m early
But what about cinnamon bears
@bringbackwinter
There cute 🥰
Honesty we deserve it
Everyone better be scared of light skins. 😬
This guy makes stuff up! There are 5 times more polar bears today than there were in the 1950s!!
Lady polar bear lol
lightskinpizzly08🐻 is typing....
Early
Okay so what about if a panda is with a polar bear or grizzly bear
It’s evolution
I feel like humanity has it coming.
I love bear
can the offspring mate with each other? some hybrids can't
Hybrids like vamp diar
The Jurassic park reference was nice
Wait does that mean pandas and grizzlys can do the uhhh yea
They can’t breed tho right
Next is honey badger and Wolverine
TWo races coming together
damn that sounds familiar.....
megafauna is on its way out. every large species of animal that isn't domesticated is going extinct in the new 300 years.
If polar bears mated with black bears would we have grey bears?
bring it to Florida 😌
You’ll have to pet it from the inside.... 😳🤣
ok. but can they reproduce. or are they like mules
yeah I just learned that in science class
Are these light skin bears bigger then the polar and grizzly bears?
It’s the fact that it’s ALL TRUE! 🤦🏾‍♀️
They’ve been a thing since 2014 I think, but now is happening naturally
That’s why I carry a gun
Bruh light skin bears 😂
You hear about the python hybrids in Florida?
evolution baby
Nesquik bears .... 🤣🤣🤣
pizzly bear or grolar vs an alligator😂
