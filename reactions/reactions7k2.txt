agradecida de vivir en latam

nesquik... 😭

i love your content but calling bears "abominations"? you've crossed the line

grizzly and polar bears i have a fear of more than any other animal and now you’re telling me there’s a hybrid of the two combined?! 😭

and we deserve it.

that’s what humans get for melting that bears home😅

lucky i live in texas

i want a prizzly bear

da haben wir den 🥗

she’s biracial

bearacial

i sense "light skin bear memes" in the future

bears have no prejudiced and make a high breed but mankind...forget about it

i want u to explain everything lol so entertaining 🤣

it’s what we deserve

please no

logic bears😳

haha bearacial

save artica

not in australia bro

pissly bears oh wait-

sounds like another situation currently happening 😅

first up how did the "interaction" even took place

these have been around for a while, but they’re relatively new, but what he’s saying is scary and sadly true

we hace a polar brown bear mix at my zoo, dunno why they let it happen

my great grandpa was in his house and he say a polar bear coming and the bear banged on the walls and my gramps put his ear to the wall and heard....

un tysmé sucré ça 🥲

moving south has never seemed like a better choice

...is it a skinned bear at the beginning...

i've read 3 sentences of this article and i'm like "what in the crap"

yup, we’re all gonna die

now we have to worry about the bears evolving??

it’s a pissed off polar bear on steroids!!!!

i’m from northern canada. i promise they won’t make it far south. they’ll stick to the snow.

it’s not like polar bears only live in the snow. they live in grasslands and tundras as well.

i’m good, no thank you

what about the fires down there? i heard the bears make it way south

exactly!!! they probably think it’s hell on earth down there and head right back up

right! we have it bad enough without hybrid bears🙄

i love it!

i. want. one

imagine having to explain to your insurance company that your car was destroyed by a grizzly bear and a polar bear hybrid 😂

where is this global warming everyone is talking about?

just when you thought the 2020s couldn’t get any weirder

waiting for someone to say "we're the virus"

this sounds like a fantasy creature wth is it doing in reality

bruhhh what

this sounds like a made-up headline. you sure this is real?

wellllll, now it’s just getting ridiculous

hmmm a new animal to be terrified of. fantastic!

okay i'm not even joking but i'm low key about to cry. i'm not ready for bears.

the world is officially ending. see y’all in another life ✌🏽

bears really about to conquer the world. first clowns, now bears.

i hope they're cute.

imagine if you see that bear

oh hell no

sooooo should i not go hiking anymore?

how do you even get a hybrid bear? like were they put in the same enclosure or what???

bro my mom made the same joke she said it’s gonna be called a pissly bear😭

noo that's a dream of mine

they just want hugs and snacks

can they have babies together? i want to see the baby

haha bears go brrrr

i was really gonna go camping in alaska this summer but- 😳

and i wanted to go to alaska

not sure what to put here.

i'm safe; i live in michigan. nothing ever happens in michigan.

honestly, let 'em take us out 🤷🏽‍♀️

wait if it’s a crossbreed between bears, would they be infertile because they aren’t the same, like a liger please answer

they really said piss bear... also, what's the difference between pizzly and grolar?

americans and canadians are scared of australian animals, but our bears are tiny, slow, and vegetarian.

are pizzly bears fertile though? usually, when two different species have a hybrid, usually they cannot reproduce (mule, liger, etc.)

it's always the lightskins who are dangerous.

this nonsense gonna be in your backyard sooner 😭

this is white genocide; stormfront was right all along.

brown guys only want white girls 😞

can a pizzly and a pizzly make a baby, or are they sterile like mules?

the info: 😥‼️😣😰👿🏴‍☠️🔪🪓❌🚩. the music: 😁💖💖🤧🤧🥳🥳😍😍😂🤪😜🦄🌝🌈🌈

whole-ass pokémon names.

me in africa worrying about animals that probably won't kill me 👈

climate change is just the earth's back-up plan in case humans mess up.

you can call them "grolars" or "puzzles"; i call them "karma."

we did this to ourselves; we deserve to get clapped by these hybrids.

you guys know the ice caps have been melting since the last ice age, right? we just sped things up.

pizzley bears...

soooo can these things have babies, or are they sterile like mules?

pissly bears...

pandas already biracial, but this is horrendous.

so can these hybrid offspring themselves
