If pizzly bears are going to survive in the wild, they might just have to pick a more intimidating name.

Some polar bears already have have CHROMOSOMES of brown bears from quite long ago.  Both have the same number of Chromosomes, and are still too closely related not to breed fertile offspring, both with the parent species and each other.  So, while physically different and occupying different environmental areas, they also meet the definition of a subspecies (probably an ancient ancestor).  Perhaps these hybrids are recreating that ancestor by interbreeding, intentionally similar things are being done with horses and some other species.

The number of confirmed hybrids has since risen to eight, all of them descending from the same female polar bear.

Once you go brown...

Does it matter which species is the boar/sow? With other hybrids, 2 different types of animals result.

Yes! Let's combine two of the strongest and unpredictable bears in north America. Being a hiker wasn't scary enough!  Keep in mind polar bears see people as food and there's little we can do about them. Not saying to kill off the polar bear but humans can't normal live in those Terrains. Nature is fighting back.

Does the polar bear and grizzly bear have the same type of courtship when breeding or did the polar bear just do whatever it wanted when it saw a grizzly?

Life fids a way. Since grizzly eats 90% vegi and the polar eats near 100% meat will the new species be more of an aggressive hunter than the grizzly? That could mean bad news for people exploring.

This idea that polar bear are heading to extinction is ludicrous. Just last year. Their population have increased to alarming rates , they are invading Inuit habitats.

polar bears have over double in population since the first study in the 60s.  They have only been left on the "Vulnerable" status because many organizations refuse to actually submit real numbers and instead use an estimate that is purely speculative and by most every real number study is false, has been false and continues to be false.  Polar Bears are moving south because there are to many to live off the seals in the Arctic. Is ice reduction an issue.  yes, in the years they actually happen but there have been record setting ice in the same decdes as record setting lack of ice.   What we really know is we have no idea what long term weather may or may not do to the Polar bear populations.  Hey I know people are an issue but lying is as bad as ignoring the issue.
